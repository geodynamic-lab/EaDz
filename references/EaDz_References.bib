   abstract = {Gamma-ray (GR) logging and detrital zircon geochronology provide new constraints on changing provenance in the southern Hailar Basin of northeastern China. The basement of this region is characterized by low GR values of 70-90 API. This is overlain by a rift-fill sequence, the GR values of which exhibit a broad range in its lower part (70-160 API), but a more restricted range (80-110 API) in its upper part. Post-rift sediments dominate the basin fill, and are characterized by higher GR values of 120-160 API. Detrital zircon samples from the lower rift sequence and post-rift sediments share similar age distributions, with a single dominant age population of 150-110 Ma. Samples from the upper rift sequence exhibit a bimodal age distribution with peaks at 180-150 Ma and 360-300 Ma. The synchronous changes in zircon age populations and GR values in the strata suggest changing sedimentary source characteristics, thus revealing a rapid shift from active rifting to post-rift thermal sagging of the Hailar Basin in the Early Cretaceous. The basal rift-fill deposits are interpreted to have been mainly derived from erosion of local highs internal to the basin itself, although acidic air-fall ash from the extensive late Mesozoic volcanism in the Great Xing'an Range probably also contributed. Post-rift sediments are dominated by materials shed from the Great Xing'an Range magmatic belt. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {The Tibetan Plateau offers an example for understanding the processes of continental collision and subsequent intracontinental deformation. The Jiuxi Basin, located at the northeastern margin of the plateau, bears crucial information on the growth processes of the NE Tibetan Plateau. Combined with published magnetostratigraphic constraints, integration of stratigraphic investigation and detrital zircon geochronological analysis on the sediments of the Cenozoic Hongliuxia section in western Jiuxi Basin suggests a major reorganization of the basin infill process at the period between depositions of the Baiyanghe and Shulehe formations at similar to 17 Ma. This finding is documented by (1) a generally upward-thinning sequence followed by an upward-coarsening sequence with corresponding changes in sedimentary facies, (2) shifting of the paleocurrent from the south to the north, and (3) shifting of the provenance from the Bei Shan-Kuantan Shan-Hei Shan in the north to the North Qilian Shan in the south. These results suggest that tectonic deformation arrived in the North Qilian Shan by similar to 17 Ma and lend support to the outward-growth model for the Tibetan Plateau.},

   abstract = {The Xiukang Melange of the Yarlung-Zangbo suture zone in south Tibet documents low efficiency of accretion along the southern active margin of Asia during Cretaceous Neotethyan subduction, followed by final development during the early Paleogene stages of the India-Asia collision. Here we present integrated petrologic, UPb detrital-zircon geochronology and Hf isotope data on different types of sandstone blocks in the Xiukang Melange. Three groups of sandstone blocks with different provenance and depositional setting are distinguished by their petrographic, geochronological and isotopic fingerprints. Blocks of turbiditic quartzarenite originally sourced from the Indian continent were deposited in pre-Cretaceous time on the northernmost edge of the Indian passive margin and eventually involved into the melange at the early stage of the India-Asia collision. Two distinct groups of volcaniclastic-sandstone blocks were derived from the central Lhasa block and Gangdese magmatic arc. One group was deposited in the trench and/or on the trench slope of the Asian margin during the early Late Cretaceous, and the other group in a syn-collisional basin just after the onset of the India-Asia collision in the Early Eocene. The largely erosional character of the Asian active margin in the Late Cretaceous is indicated by the scarcity of off-scraped trench-fill deposits and the relatively small subduction complex developed during limited episodes of accretion. The Xiukang Melange was finally structured in the Late Paleocene/Eocene, when sandstone blocks of both Indian and Asian origin were progressively incorporated tectonically in the suture zone of the nascent Himalayan Orogen.

The Luogangcuo Formation was deposited (ca. 88-81 Ma) in a trench environment on a deep-sea fan fed from the Lhasa block through a submarine canyon. Dominant chert and subordinate sandstone and limestone clasts in conglomerate beds indicate recycling from the Neo-Tethyan subduction complex during repeated episodes of gravitational failure. The interbedded turbiditic sandstones were sourced directly from the Gangdese magmatic arc and central Lhasa terrane. Detrital volumes from the active Asian margin increased markedly at ca. 88 Ma as a result of uplift of central Lhasa, leading to deltaic progradation, filling of the Xigaze forearc basin, and bypassing of sediments funneled via canyons across the subduction complex to reach the Luogangcuo trench basin at abyssal depths.},

   abstract = {Our new stratigraphic, sedimentological, and micropaleontological analysis, integrated with basalt geochemistry, sandstone petrography, and detrital-zircon U-Pb and Hf isotope data, suggests the revision of current models for the geological evolution of the Asian active margin during the Cretaceous. The Xigaze forearc basin began to form in the late Early Cretaceous, south of the Gangdese arc, during the initial subduction of the Neotethyan oceanic lithosphere under the Lhasa terrane. Well-preserved stratigraphic successions document the classical upward-shallowing pattern of the forearc-basin strata and elucidate the origin of the associated oceanic magmatic rocks. The normal mid-ocean-ridge basalt (N-MORB) geochemical signature and stratigraphic contact with the overlying abyssal cherts (Chongdui Formation) indicate that the Xigaze Ophiolite formed by forearc spreading and represents the basement of the forearc sedimentary sequence. Volcaniclastic sedimentation began with thick turbiditic sandstones and interbedded shales in the late Albian-Santonian (Ngamring Formation) followed by shelfal, deltaic, and fluvial strata (Padana Formation), with final filling of the basin by the Campanian age. Forearc sandstones do not show the classical trend from feldspatholithic volcaniclastic to quartzo-feldspathic plutoniclastic compositions, indicating limited unroofing of the Gangdese arc prior to collision. U-Pb age spectra of detrital zircons are unimodal with a 107 Ma peak in the lower Ngamring Formation (104-99 Ma), bimodal with a subordinate additional peak at 157 Ma in the middle Ngamring Formation (99-88 Ma), and multimodal with more abundant pre-Mesozoic ages in the upper Ngamring and Padana Formations (88-76 Ma). These three petrofacies with distinct provenances document the progressive erosional evolution of the Gangdese arc, with uplift of the central Lhasa terrane and expanding river catchments to include the central Lhasa terrane during the Late Cretaceous.},

Among these, the India to Asia provenance reversal (IAPR) documented in the Indian passive margin successions has proved to be most effective. We present integrated stratigraphic, sedimentological, and provenance data on Upper Cretaceous-Paleogene strata from the newly investigated Mubala section exposed south of the Yarlung-Zangbo suture zone (YZSZ) in southern Tibet, which preserves continuous deep-marine turbiditic and biogenic sedimentation on the distal Indian passive margin. Sandstone petrography, heavy minerals, detrital zircon geochronology and Hf isotopes, and detrital Cr-spinel geochemistry constrain the IAPR to later than 62.7 Ma (youngest zircon ages from the earliest Asian-derived sandstone) and by 61.0 +/- 0.3 Ma (SIMS age of a tuffaceous layer similar to 30 m above this bed). The onset of intercontinental collision along the YZSZ began by 61 Ma.},

   abstract = {The mass burial of dinosaur bone fossils in the Late Cretaceous Wangshi Group in Zhucheng, Shandong Province has been a research focus in recent years. However, the provenance of the dinosaur bone fossils and the accurate depositional age of the bone beds remain ambiguous. Through U-Pb dating of detrital zircons collected from six conglomerate samples from the dinosaur bone beds, we found that the youngest single grain age (YSG) of sample 090414-24-D was 77.3 Ma, representing the maximum depositional age of the dinosaur fossil beds and sediments. This also indicates that the Hongtuya Formation was deposited during the Campanian. Dating results revealed an age peak of 120-110 Ma, which corresponds with the peak age of volcanic rocks of the Lower Cretaceous Qingshan Group. The volcanic rocks of the Qingshan Group are mainly exposed in Laiyang, to the north of Zhucheng, although a few also appear to the south and northwest. Through analysis of conglomerate composition and palaeocurrents in the sediments containing the bone beds, we found that the three different data sets of gravel compositions of the conglomerates were mainly composed of volcanic or pyroclastic rocks. Three different data sets of palaeocurrents suggested that the main sediment source of the Wangshi Group dinosaur bone beds was from the north-northwest of the Basin. Only one data set had a provenance south of the basin. This study revealed that the areas of Laiyang and the Yishu Fault Zone were the main provenance areas of both the dinosaur bone fossils and the sediments of the Wangshi Group in Zhucheng. The southern margin of the Zhucheng Basin may be a secondary source area. This research provides an important basis for judging the deposition time and the sediment source of fossil layers in the Wangshi Group, as well as reconstructing the palaeogeography of the Wangshi Group in the Jiaolai Basin.

   abstract = {The Khao Khwang fold-and-thrust belt, central Thailand, developed within a basin that formed on the southwestern margin of the Indochina block. Because of limited geochronological and provenance constraints, the time of deposition, sediment source location, and tectonic significance of the basin have been uncertain. Here, we present 837 U-Pb detrital zircon ages and 271 Hf isotope in situ analyses from Permian-Triassic clastic units within the Khao Khwang fold-and-thrust belt in order to constrain the provenance, maximum depositional ages, and depositional environment of the southwestern margin of the Indochina terrane through the late Paleozoic to early Mesozoic. The key lithological units, the Sap Bon, Pang Asok, and Nong Pong Formations, are part of the Saraburi Group and have detrital age spectra spanning from Late Triassic to Paleoarchean. The entire data set has a common age peak at ca. 450 Ma, and all samples contain grains with ages of 0.2-0.3, 0.4-0.6, 1.0-1.3, 1.7-1.8, and 2.2-2.7 Ga. A few grains predate 3.0 Ga. Multidimensional scaling analysis of detrital zircon ages from throughout SE Asia demonstrates that the age spectra of the siliciclastic units of the Saraburi Group resemble those of Permian-Triassic detritus found elsewhere in the Khorat Plateau and throughout Vietnam and southeast China, implying that these areas shared similar sources. These sources may have been the, now largely -covered, Indo-china basement, and/or contiguous continental crust in terranes already amalgamated to Indochina at that time. Detrital zircons as young as 205 +/- 6 Ma show that some formations of the Saraburi Group, previously considered to be of Middle-Late Permian age, are no older than Late Triassic. We propose a depositional model for the region of a Permian rift or passive-margin setting that evolved into piggyback and foredeep basins during an extended period of folding and thrusting in the Triassic.},

   abstract = {This study reported the detrital zircon U-Pb geochronology of the Cenozoic sequence exposed in Kotli, northwestern Himalaya, Pakistan, which forms part of the Kashmir foreland basin. The U-Pb detrital age patterns of the Paleocene Patala Formation show a major age cluster between ~130-290 Ma, ~500-1000 Ma and ~1000-1500 Ma, which mainly resembles the lesser and higher Himalayan sequence. However, the younger age pattern (~130-290 Ma) can be matched to the ages of the ophiolites exposed along the Indus-Tsangpo suture zone. In addition, two younger grains with 57 Ma and 55 Ma ages may indicate a contribution from the Kohistan-Ladakh arc. The detrital zircons in the upper Tertiary sequence show the increased input of younger detrital ages <100 Ma, with more pronounced peaks at ~36-58 Ma, ~72-94 Ma and ~102-166 Ma, indicating the strong resemblance to the Asian sources including the Kohistan-Ladakh arc, Karakoram block and Gangdese batholith. This provenance shift, recorded in the upper portion of Patala Formation and becoming more visible in the upper Tertiary clastic sequence (Kuldana and Murree formations), is related to the collision of the Indian and Asian plates in the northwestern Himalayas. Considering the age of the Patala Formation, we suggest that the Indian and Asian plates collided during 57-55 Ma in the northwestern Himalayas, Pakistan.},

   abstract = {Santunying is an important area for revealing nature of the late Neoarchean tectono-magmato-thermal events in the eastern Hebei part of the North China Craton. It is mainly composed of meta-intrusive rocks. Supracrustal rocks sporadically occur in the meta-intrusive rocks. The meta-intrusive rocks are subdivided into the Santunying tonalitic gneiss, Qiuhuayu tonalitic-trondhjemitic gneiss, Xiaoguanzhuang dioritic gneiss and Qingyangshu meta-gabbro. Respectively, SHRIMP U-Pb zircon dating on fourteen samples yielded weighted mean (20)(7)pb/Pb-206 ages of 2525-2537, 2532-2546, 2530-2544 and similar to 2531 Ma for magmatic zircons from them. Dioritic gneiss of the Xiaoguanzhuang gneiss contain abundant 2544-3487 Ma xenocrystic zircons. SHRIMP U-Pb dating on a garnet-biotite gneiss sample yielded a weighted mean( 207)pb/Pb-206 age of 2537 Ma for detrital zircons. All rocks underwent strong metamorphism, deformation and anatexis, resulting in formation of leucosomes and residues, with some leucosomes concentrating to form large veins. They record a strong late Neoarchean event by metamorphic zircon ages of 2489-2519 Ma. Some rocks also record metamorphic zircon ages of 1772-1843 Ma. Magmatic zircons from the magmatic rocks show large variations in is an element of(Hf)( t) values ranging from -1.7 to +8.7. Combined with early studies, conclusions are: 1) Intrusive rocks with the involvement of mantle-derived materials have a narrow range of magmatic zircon ages from 2525 to 2546 Ma, and supracrustal rocks were formed during the same period. 2) Ancient crustal remnants (>2600 Ma) are present, consistent with the late Neoarchean arc magmatism involving older continental crust, similar to Phanerozoic Andean margins. 3) The Archean basement underwent a strong tectonothermal event at the end of the Neoarchean, with the metamorphic zircon ages being 10-30 million years younger than the timing of magmatism, a common feature of the North China Craton. 4) A late Paleoproterozoic tectonothermal event widely occurred in the western part of eastern Hebei, which is linked with regional ductile deformation.

LA-ICP-MS zircon U-Pb isotopic dating for the DUG gneisses in the Qinglong area reveals that their magmatic precursors were emplaced between 2517 +/- 10 and 2505 +/- 23 Ma. Zircons of these DTTG gneisses exhibit positive epsilon(Hf)(t) values of 0.0 to +6.5, with adakite-like geochemical features represented by relatively high MgO, Mg# and (La/Yb)(N) ratios. Petrogenetic studies reveal that dioritic magmas were derived from depleted mantle peridotites that were strongly modified by slab-derived melts/fluids and that the tonalitic-trondhjemitic-granodioritic (TTG) magmas were formed by a high degree of fractional crystallization in the dioritic magmas with hornblende as the primary fractionated phase. LA-ICP-MS zircon U-Pb isotopic analyses reveal that the protoliths of the felsic paragneisses in the Northern Zunhua area were deposited in the Late Neoarchean with a maximum depositional age of 2517 +/- 20 Ma. Most of the detrital zircon grains display apparent Pb-207/Pb-206 ages from 3432 +/- 20 to 2502 +/- 21 Ma, with negative epsilon(Hf)(t) values of -15.4 to -2.4 and calculated T-DM(C) ages between 3995 and 3368 Ma, suggesting that they were formed from the recycling of Eo-to Paleoarchean crustal materials closely related to the southeastern ancient continental crust of the interior Eastern Block. These data together with previous investigations reveal that the basement rocks of Zunhua-Qinglong microblock formed in a Neoarchean arc-back-arc system with the subduction direction from present northwest to southeast.

   abstract = {Recently, how to quantitatively estimate the growth rate of continental crust is an enigmatic issue. With the development of ICP-MS technology, the U Pb dating and Lu Hf isotopic compositions of detrital zircons from the fluvial sediments can provide an effective and simple approach to constrain the growth rate and evolutionary history of continental crust. In this paper, 189 concordant detrital zircons from the Laoha River have been analyzed for U Pb ages and Lu Hf isotopic compositions by excimer LA-MC-ICP-MS. Detrital zircons from samples LH and LH2 show three major age groups, i.e., 2370 Ma-2572 Ma, 1728-2087 Ma, 127-376 Ma and 2374-2598 Ma, 1765-2087 Ma, 119-405 Ma, respectively. They have the common prominent two stage Hf model ages with a peak at ca. 2.7 Ga, which is consistent with the global continental crust. These indicate that the timing of the strongest magmatic events is at ca. 2.5 Ga and 1.8 Ga, and the best estimation age of mantle extraction of the northeast margin of North China Craton is ca. 2.7 Ga. The detrital zircons with U Pb ages of 1.8 Ga and 2.5 Ga have the two stage Hf model ages of ca. 2.7 Ga, whereas sHf(t) values are different from those of depleted mantle. These indicate that the majority of continental crust of the northeast margin of North China Craton at time of 1.8 Ga originated from the reworking of 2.7 Ga crust. About 5% of the present crustal volume in the northeast margin of North China Craton was formed at 2.9 Ga; whilst 64% of the present crustal volume in the northeast margin of North China Craton has been formed at 2.5 Ga, which is higher than that of previous studies. It suggests that the continental crust growth in the North China Craton is not uniform, but it is consistent with the episodic growth of global continental crust (60%). Moreover, the majority continental crust of the northeast margin of North China Craton has been formed at 1.8 Ga (84%) as previously interpreted. Finally, we have used formulas to quantitatively calculate the reworking rate and give a suggestion that the time of 2.5 Ga is also the main growth period of continental crust of the North China Craton, and the time of 1.8 Ga is the strongest reworking period of the continental crust in the craton. In addition, the reworking rate began to drop after reactivating in the North China Craton, and the addition of depleted mantle was gradually increased.},

   abstract = {This study describes a previously unidentified Neoproterozoic mafic dyke emplaced in the northern flank of the Langshan Tectonic Belt. This dyke intruded into the micaquartz schist of the Zhaertaishan Group, and yielded an age of 908 +/- 8 Ma. The youngest UePb ages of micaquartz schist from the Zhaertaishan Group in the Langshan area were 1118 +/- 33 Ma, 1187 +/- 3 Ma and 1189 +/- 39 Ma, suggesting that the depositional age of the protolith of the schist was between 908 +/- 8 Ma and 1118 +/- 33 Ma. In addition, 436 UePb age data and 155 Lu-Hf isotopic data from six samples in the Langshan Tectonic Belt and one Permian greywacke from the Wuhai area show distinct differences between the northern and southern flanks of the Main Langshan area. The UePb ages of the northern flank are primarily Meso-Neoproterozoic; similar ages have not been identified in the southern flank to date. Moreover, two-stage Hf model ages of the northern flank feature three age peaks at similar to 900 Ma, similar to 1700 Ma and similar to 2600 Ma; this differs from Hf model ages of the southern flank, which feature one strong age peak at similar to 2700 Ma. These results suggest that the northern and southern flanks of the Main Langshan area have different geochronologic characteristics and should be divided further. Based on the UePb ages and Hf model ages, the northern and southern flanks of the Main Langshan area are named the North and South Langshan Tectonic Belts. Comparison of the UePb age and two-stage Hf model age distributions from the North Langshan Tectonic Belt, South Langshan Tectonic Belt, Alxa Block and the North China Craton (NCC) reveal that the North Langshan Tectonic Belt is similar to the Alxa Block and that the South Langshan Tectonic Belt is similar to the NCC. In addition, the zircon UePb age of 860 +/- 7 Ma commonly observed in the Alxa Block was detected in the Permian greywacke from the Wuhai area of the NCC, which suggests that the amalgamation of the North and South Langshan Tectonic belts (i.e., the amalgamation of the Alxa Block and the NCC), occurred between Devonian and late Permian.

   abstract = {The development and formation times of the Yellow River, the second largest drainage system in China, remain controversial. The Ganhegou Formation, a set of Upper Miocene-Pliocene fluvial facies sediments, developed around Niushou Mountain in the outermost edge of the arcuate structural belt in the northeastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau and has a sediment composition very similar to that of the Yellow River. In this article, the relationship between the deposition of the Ganhegou Formation and the Yellow River is confirmed through the analysis and comparison of sediment composition, detrital zircons, and heavy mineral characteristics of the Ganhegou Formation, a Yellow River terrace, and the modern Yellow River. The sediments of the Ganhegou Formation contain abundant well-ground and sorted fluvial pebbles that are largely consistent with Yellow River sediments. The analysis of the composition of zircons and heavy minerals shows that the age peaks of all detrital zircons are primarily among 200-300 Ma, 400-500 Ma, and 1,700-2,000 Ma and that all the heavy minerals are generally characterized by the combination of 'haematite + garnet + zircon + epidote + quartz and altered minerals'. Therefore, the Ganhegou Formation in the Niushou Mountain area of Ningxia is a likely sediment of the ancient Yellow River, which has existed at Qingtongxia since at least the Late Miocene.},

   abstract = {The present study integrates detrital zircon U-Pb-Hf isotopic analysis from 13 sandstone samples from an Upper Cretaceous-Miocene sedimentary sequence in Nepal Himalaya to determine their provenance. These sequences constrain a shifting of provenance from south to north. The U-Pb ages from Upper Cretaceous-Palaeocene strata (Amile Formation) mainly cluster between similar to 1,860 and 1,400 Ma with a peak at similar to 1,630 Ma and an absence of grains younger than the Palaeoproterozoic (1,400 Ma) age. The detritus yielded positive detrital zircon epsilon(Hf) (t) values (as high as +10). However, the detrital zircon U-Pb ages from Eocene-Miocene sequence cluster at similar to 500-650, similar to 700-900, similar to 1,600-1,850, and similar to 2,500 Ma, and in addition, they have both positive and negative epsilon(Hf) (t) values (+11 to -25). This finding further elucidates that the detritus in the Amile Formation was entirely sourced from India, which changed following the time of the Bhainskati Formation deposition, to a mixture of both Asian and Indian affinities (the Himalayan region). This change in source region marks the possible time of the India-Asia collision during this transition phase, that is, Late Palaeocene-Earliest Eocene.},

This study presents detrital zircon U-Pb ages from the late Palaeocene-Eocene Yinkiong Group in NE India. The samples are from the late Palaeocene to early Eocene Lower Yinkiong Formation, and the Upper Yinkiong Formation deposited during the early to mid-Eocene within the Himalayan foreland basin. The U-Pb ages of the detrital zircon within the Lower Yinkiong Formation are older than late Palaeozoic, with a cratonic and early Himalayan Thrust Belt affinity, whereas the Cenozoic grains in the Upper Yinkiong Formation indicate a Himalayan Thrust Belt source and possibly a granitic body within the Asian plate. The shift of the sources and the changes in the foreland basin system strongly suggest that the India-Asia collision in the Eastern Himalaya began before or immediately after the deposition of the Upper Yinkiong Formation, i.e., within the early Eocene (c. 56 to 50 Ma).},

Though a rough framework has emerged describing the tectonic evolution of the Pamir, detailed knowledge of the spatial and temporal evolution of Cenozoic deformation is necessary to determine how strain progressed through the orogenic belt. Here we present new stratigraphic, zircon provenance, and stable isotope data from Jurassic to Miocene strata along the Pamir's northeastern margin near the town of Oytag (Wuyitake) in the Tarim Basin (west China). Prominent similar to 40 Ma peaks in Oligocene to early Miocene detrital zircon grains record the erosion of an Eocene belt of shoshonitic rocks in the central to southeastern Pamir. This is roughly coincident with an similar to 4 parts per thousand shift in the oxygen isotopic composition (delta O-18) of carbonates during the Eocene and/or Oligocene (from an average of -8.7 parts per thousand, to -12.6 parts per thousand), suggesting a reorganization of atmospheric circulation during that time. This could have been caused by uplift of Tarim Basin-bounding ranges and/or retreat of the Paratethys Sea. A subsequent change from Eocene to Jurassic aged detrital zircon grains in the early to middle Miocene indicates provenance shifted from source rocks in the central and/or SE Pamir to the hanging wall of the Main Pamir Thrust (MPT), coincident with prograding facies at that time. This suggests deformation progressed outward toward the northeast margin of the Pamir plateau in the early to middle Miocene. Our results corroborate outward advancement of Himalayan deformation, affecting all margins of the Tarim Basin by the middle Miocene. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

We present a new geologic map of fluvial-deltaic deposits of the Indo-Burman Ranges (IBR), five detrital zircon fission track analyses, and twelve high-n detrital zircon U-Pb age distributions (dzUPb) from the Barail (late Eocene-early Miocene), Surma (early-late Miocene), and Tipam (late Miocene-Pliocene) Groups of the ancestral Brahmaputra delta. We use dzUPb statistical tests to correlate the IBR units with equivalent age strata throughout the Bengal Basin. An influx of trans-Himalayan sediment and the first appearance of similar to 50 Ma grains of the Gangdese batholith in the lower Surma Group (similar to 18-15 Ma) records the early Miocene arrival of the ancestral Brahmaputra delta to the Bengal Basin. Contributions from Himalayan sources systematically decrease up section through the late Miocene as the contribution of Trans-Himalayan Arc sources increases. The Miocene (similar to 18-8 Ma) deposition of the Surma Group records upstream expansion of the ancestral Brahmaputra River into southeastern Tibet. Late Miocene (<8 Ma) progradation of the fluvial part of the delta (Tipam Group) routed trans-Himalayan sediment over the shelf edge to the Nicobar Fan. We propose that Miocene progradation of the ancestral Brahmaputra delta reflects increasing rates of erosion and sea level fall during intensification of the South Asian Monsoon after the Miocene Climate Optimum, contemporaneous with a pulse of tectonic uplift of the Himalayan hinterland and Tibet.},

   abstract = {Detrital age relationship between major lithounits of the orogeny and foreland basin strata can elucidate orogenic events. However, analyses of some selected samples of a certain time interval from a sedimentary basin can lead to misjudgement. We present detrital zircon U-Pb age analyses of some older sedimentary strata of the Tansen Group, a renowned basin for the explanation of the Himalayan Orogeny. Sandstone and tuff samples of the Permian and Cretaceous Periods from the Gondwana sequence of the Lesser Himalaya of eastern Nepal and western Nepal were subjected to U-Pb age analyses, and the results were compared with available younger strata of the same basin along with the major lithotectonic units of the Himalaya. The detrital zircon age population of different units enables us to propose a new stratigraphic framework for the eastern Nepal Gondwana sequence and correlate them with the well-established Gondwana sequence of the western Nepal Lesser Himalaya. This study reveals that the source region for the Gondwana sequence (Permian to Cretaceous) and post-Gondwana sequence (Eocene to Miocene) is alternating and casts doubt upon the famous implications for the India and Asia collision and metamorphic core exhumation made from the basin analysis of these sedimentary basins of the southern part of the Himalayan Thrust Fold Belt (HTFB). Furthermore, we argue that these basins cannot be used for the reconstruction of collision and exhumation history of the Himalaya as being used. Alternatively, the results are more consistent with the possibilities of recent unconventional hypotheses of sediment contribution of the Greater Himalaya to the Permian strata of the Lesser Himalaya and the Cretaceous rifting of the Tibetan-Himalayan Microcontinent followed by the accretion of the microcontinent before collision of India and Asia.},

   abstract = {The timing of the India-Asia collision is greatly debated and is critical for elucidating early orogenic processes. This study documents, for the first time, evidence of India-Asia detrital mixing in the continental sedimentary rocks of the India-Asia collision zone of NW India at ca. 50 Ma and presents the largest detrital zircon (DZ) U-Pb age data set (n = 1225) from the region. Our DZ U-Pb age spectra from the early Eocene-late Oligocene continental Indus Group reveal a hybrid India-Asia provenance. The dominant Mesozoic-Cenozoic DZ peaks are ca. 107 Ma, 100-80 Ma, 60-50 Ma, 40 Ma, and 26 Ma, and they are mostly derived from Asia. The primary Precambrian DZ peaks are ca. 2.5 Ga, 1.2-0.95 Ga, 0.78-0.63 Ga, and 0.55 Ga and are representative of Tethyan Himalayan rocks on Greater India. Maximum depositional ages (MDAs) for four key Indus Group units, the Nurla, Hemis, Basgo, and Temesgam Formations, support syn-orogenic deposition in the Indus Basin from early Eocene to at least late Oligocene time. The Nurla Formation, with an MDA of ca. 50 Ma, records the first arrival of Greater Indian zircons on the Asian plate, thereby indicating uplift and erosion along the subducting Indian plate and collision of India with Asia by ca. 50 Ma. The ca. 27-26 Ma zircons in the younger late Oligocene Basgo and Temesgam Formations were contributed by the Lhasa terrane in south Tibet, which implies that the Indus River flowed from east to west across NW India at least by ca. 27 Ma.},

   abstract = {The Chinese Loess Plateau in north central China contains one of the most valuable Cenozoic climate archives on land. Establishing the origin of this substantial archive of aeolian sediments is critical for the interpretation of loess climate proxies, past atmospheric wind patterns and changing climatic/tectonic controls on erosion over potentially the past 25 Ma. Despite this significance there are a number of disagreements over the precise source areas and the extent to which these vary through time and across the plateau. To address this, we utilize a multi-technique, approach of combined detrital single-grain zircon U-Pb dating and heavy mineral analysis to establish the sources of loess through the Quaternary and constrain their variation geographically across the Loess Plateau. We combine our data with suitable published single-grain datasets from loess and possible source regions. The results demonstrate a dramatic spatial heterogeneity of dust sources across the plateau. Sites to the west of the Loess Plateau show strong affinity to the Yellow River and the northern Tibetan Plateau, while further east the influence of North-China-Craton-derived material becomes more significant (Fig. 1). This spatial variability in source implies a far more complex relationship to dust sources than previously envisioned. The provenance of loess/soil units also varies through time, although there is no consistent relationship between these shifts and changing glacial/interglacial periods, as hypothesized previously. This variation demonstrates highly dynamic and variable dust sources and transport modes that are influenced by abrupt climate shifts within individual glacial-interglacial episodes, and potentially the dynamics of the Yellow River system.

   abstract = {U-Pb dating of detrital zircons from metamorphic and unmetamorphosed siliciclastic units in northern, central, and southern parts of the late Paleozoic South Tianshan (STS) orogen allows us to elucidate depositional ages and provenances of studied deposits and provide important insights into Paleozoic tectonics and evolution of the southwest Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB). In the northern flank of the orogen, the depositional age of metasandstones of the Kembel Complex has been constrained to 446-417Ma. Greenschist-facies metasandstones of the Kan Complex, associated with the Turkestan suture and previously related to Proterozoic, yielded maximum depositional ages of 438-428 Ma based on the youngest clusters of detrital zircons, although the occurrence of a few younger grains implies, that these rocks may be late Silurian to Devonian in age. Greenschists of the Kan Complex were likely metamorphosed during the Mississippian (>330 Ma),based on the early Serpukhovian age of overlying strata. A similar depositional age has been proven for sandstones of the Balykty Formation, east of the Talas-Ferghana Fault. Detrital zircons ages for these metasediments suggest clastic provenances within Northern and Middle Tianshan. In the axial parts of the STS, coarse-grained turbidite sandstones yielded Silurian to Early Devonian maximum ages. The axial part of the STS was separated from continental domains in the north and south by deep-marine basins; therefore, these turbidite sandstones must have been derived from a local provenance in the STS. This local provenance is comprised of Precambrian crustal fragments, as indicated by high concentration of Precambrian magmatic zircons in detrital populations, along with Silurian and Devonian arc magmatic rocks. Precambrian crust can be inferred in the basement of the Alai microcontinent and Baubashata carbonate platform, which represented the likely provenance areas. Detrital zircons with Ediacaran 650-550 Ma ages in turbidites suggest that during the Neoproterozoic, these crustal fragments may have comprised a single continental domain with the Karakum-Tajik (Garm massif) and Tarim microcontinents, where magmatic rocks and detrital zircons with such ages have been also previously dated. Devonian slope turbidite facies of the Tarim Craton in the south Ferghana Range contain Precambrian detrital zircons with ages matching those of the Tarim, and numerous Paleozoic zircons clustering at 446 and 441 Ma. Paleozoic zircon ages indicate the occurrence of unidentified Ordovician and early Silurian magmatic rocks in northern and western Tarim. New data provide further evidence that Paleozoic evolution of CAOB was controlled by northward motion of the Precambrian terranes rifted off the Gondwana and colliding with the continental masses of Kazakhstan and Siberia in the north.

   abstract = {The Zavkhan terrane is a Proterozoic cratonic fragment in southwestern Mongolia that forms the core of the Central Asian orogenic belt. We provide new geologic and U-Pb zircon geochronologic constraints on the Neoproterozoic and early Paleozoic tectonic evolution of the terrane. Orthogneisses dated as ca. 1967 and ca. 839 Ma form the basement and are intruded and overlain by ca. 811-787 Ma arc-volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks that lack a gneissic fabric, suggestive of a mid-Neoproterozoic metamorphic event. Rifting and formation of the Zavkhan ribbon continent occurred from ca. 770-717 Ma and was followed by passive margin sedimentation between 717 and 580 Ma. During the latest Ediacaran to Cambrian, the southern margin of the Zavkhan terrane was reactivated with the obduction of the Lake terrane, slab break-off and reversal, and ca. 509-507 Ma magmatism. Metamorphosed Proterozoic and Cambrian units are cut by undeformed ca. 496 Ma gabbro, providing a tight constraint on the age of Cambrian metamorphism. Late Ordovician to Silurian rifting is marked by bimodal magmatism and deposition in narrow fault-bound basins. Our data indicate that the Zavkhan terrane traveled alone in the Neoproterozoic, collided with the Lake terrane in the late Ediacaran to Cambrian, accreted an unknown crustal block during Cambrian Epoch 2-Epoch 3, and then rifted away in the Ordovician. We suggest the majority of continental growth in Mongolia occurred through the trapping and oroclinal bending of ribbon continents rather than long-lived accretion on the margin of a major craton.},

   abstract = {Although the Phanerozoic geology of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt is extensively studied, there is still much to reveal about the initiation and early stages of tectonism. The Gargan block of the Tuva-Mongolia terranes at the Mongolian-Russian border is one of the Archean-Proterozoic continental crustal fragments that record the earliest evolutionary history of the belt. To better constrain the age of its basement, extent, and provenance in regional tectonic framework, we present new zircon U-Pb geochronologic data from previously undated basement gneisses and the overlying Neoproterozoic meta-sedimentary rocks of southern part of the Gargan block. Comparison of available basement ages and Precambrian detrital zircon spectra from nearby Archean-Proterozoic continental crustal fragments show complex relationship amongst them. We propose that the Gargan block travelled by itself in most of the Proterozoic or was derived from an unknown continental block. Obtained age confirms the existence of Neoarchean-Neoproterozoic basement in the region; however, for the first time, the 2749-814Ma Salig Complex reveals multiple stages of Neoproterozoic metamorphic events within the Central Asian Orogenic Belt. Older of which, at similar to 1 Ga, may relate to an assembly of several of the pre-existing continental crustal fragments in Mongolia. (c) 2019 International Association for Gondwana Research.

   abstract = {The Himalayan orogen provides a type example on which a number of models of the causes and consequences of crustal deformation are based and it has been suggested that it is the site of a variety of feedbacks between tectonics and erosion. Within the broader orogen, fluvial drainages partly reflect surface uplift, different climatic zones and a response to crustal deformation. In the eastern Himalaya, the unusual drainage configuration of the Yarlung Tsangpo-Brahmaputra River has been interpreted either as antecedent drainage distorted by the India-Asia collision (and as such applied as a passive strain marker of lateral extrusion), latest Neogene tectonically-induced river capture, or glacial damming-induced river diversion events. Here we apply a multi-technique approach to the Neogene paleo-Brahmaputra deposits of the Surma Basin (Bengal Basin, Bangladesh) to test the long-debated occurrence and timing of river capture of the Yarlung Tsangpo by the Brahmaputra River. We provide U-Pb detrital zircon and rutile, isotopic (Sr-Nd and Hf) and petrographic evidence consistent with river capture of the Yarlung Tsangpo by the Brahmaputra River in the Early Miocene. We document influx of Cretaceous-Paleogene zircons in Early Miocene sediments of the paleo-Brahmaputra River that we interpret as first influx of material from the Asian plate (Transhimalayan arc) indicative of Yarlung Tsangpo contribution. Prior to capture, the predominantly Precambrian-Paleozoic zircons indicate that only the Indian plate was drained. Contemporaneous with Transhimalayan influx reflecting the river capture, we record arrival of detrital material affected by Cenozoic metamorphism, as indicated by rutiles and zircons with Cenozoic U-Pb ages and an increase in metamorphic grade of detritus as recorded by petrography. We interpret this as due to a progressively increasing contribution from the erosion of the metamorphosed core of the orogen. Whole rock Sr-Nd isotopic data from the same samples provide further support to this interpretation. River capture may have been caused by a change in relative base level due to uplift of the Tibetan plateau. Assuming such river capture occurred via the Siang River in the Early Miocene, we refute the "tectonic aneurysm" model of tectonic-erosion coupling between river capture and rapid exhumation of the eastern syntaxis, since a time interval of at least 10 Ma between these two events is now demonstrated. This work is also the first to highlight U-Pb dating on detrital rutile as a powerful approach in provenance studies in the Himalaya in combination with zircon U-Pb chronology. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

   abstract = {Sandstone petrographic and U-Pb detrital zircon analyses of Upper Triassic sedimentary rocks from the northern margin of India (Tethyan Himalaya Sequence) and southern margin of Eurasia (Lhasa terrane) provide new constraints on the Mesozoic paleogeography of Neo-Tethyan Ocean basins. The Upper Triassic Nieru Formation of the Tethyan Himalaya Sequence (THS) near Lazi city (similar to 29 degrees N, 87.5 degrees E) is dominated by Indian-affinity, Precambrian detrital zircons, which are typical of the majority of the THS. However, the Upper Triassic Langjiexue Formation of the THS exposed to the east (at 90-93 degrees E longitude) includes significant populations of Permian to Early Jurassic (291-184 Ma) detrital zircons for which there is no known Indian source. In addition, the Upper Triassic Nieru Formation near Kangma town (similar to 28.5 degrees N, 90 degrees E), located similar to 200 km to the southeast of Lazi city, yielded detrital zircon age spectra that are similar to those of Langjiexue Formation. Based on detrital zircon age spectra comparisons, we propose that both the Langjiexue and Nieru formations were derived from continental crustal fragments that were adjacent to the northwestern margin of Australia. Furthermore, we suggest that these THS units, and age-equivalent strata in Northwest Australia, West Sulawesi, Timor and West Papua, comprised a Late Triassic submarine fan along the northern Australian shelf. The Upper Triassic Mailonggang Formation in the southern Lhasa terrane (35 km northeast of Lhasa city, similar to 30 degrees N, 91.5 degrees E) is dominated by Permian detrital zircons, which were likely derived from proximal Lhasa terrane sources. The Mailonggang Formation differs from all age-equivalent strata in the Tethyan Himalaya; therefore we interpret that it was separated from Greater India by the Neo-Tethyan Ocean.

   abstract = {The North China Craton (NCC) has been flanked by the North Qilian and North Qinling arc-accretionary belts to the south and southwest since similar to 400 Ma. The part of the NCC to the east of the Alax terrane (E-NCC) experienced a long sedimentary hiatus and tectonic quiescence between the Middle Ordovician and the late Carboniferous. The northern margin of the E-NCC was reactivated and uplifted with contemporaneous volcanism during the late Carboniferous, an event that partly induced the transformation of the E-NCC from an erosional platform to a continental sedimentary basin. However, the factors controlling this transformation are still not fully understood. A series of sedimentary rocks overlying Ordovician carbonates in the southwestern E-NCC contains a lower iron-oxide layer and an upper phyllosilicate layer. Detrital zircons from different parts of the profile, from the base to the top of the two layers, have similar U-Pb ages. These zircons have a minimum age of ca. 300 Ma and a prominent peak at ca. 450 Ma, with subordinate peaks at ca. 1000 and 2500 Ma. The near-identical minimum age for the two layers suggests they were semi-simultaneously deposited in the late Carboniferous after the long hiatus in sedimentation. Detrital zircons with ages of similar to 450 Ma have initial Hf isotopic compositions that vary from large negative to elevated positive. These data, together with the trace element compositions of these zircons, indicate that these minerals formed in a continental arc environment. Samples from the upper sedimentary layer contain mica group minerals that are weakly buckled and fractured, and have weathered to form clay minerals, including chlorite and illite. This suggests that the protolith of this sedimentary layer was dominated by mica schist or mica-bearing granitoid that most likely located near the adjoined part between the North Qilian and North Qinling arc-accretionary belts. Detrital zircons with the youngest ages (ca. 300 Ma) were considered to derive from the northern marginal region of the E-NCC, an area characterized by contemporaneous volcanism. The co-existence of the 450 and 300 Ma groups of detrital zircons also suggests that the northern and southern marginal regions of the E-NCC underwent almost simultaneous late Carboniferous tectonic uplift and denudation, a tectonic change that led to the formation of the sedimentary basins within the E-NCC. Late Carboniferous phyllosilicate layers within the profile are likely to be the equivalent of economically important diaspore and clay dominated bauxites within the E-NCC, suggesting that the diaspore in these bauxites was derived from mica group minerals by resolution-precipitation processes.

   abstract = {The Great Oxidation Event (GOE) and Lomagundi-Jatuli Event (LJE) during Paleoprterozoic Era represent significant global environmental changes in Earth's history and their geological records have been identified from many ancient cratons. However, reliable records of GOE and LJE are rare in the North China Craton (NCC) due to high-grade metamorphism on Paleoproterozoic strata during Orosirian Period and poor age constraints. Weakly metamorphosed to unmetamorphosed Proterozoic strata termed as Fanhe Group of around 8 km thick are well preserved in Fanhe Basin in the Archean Longgang Block in northeastern NCC and the Guanmenshan Formation from the lower part of the Fanhe Group is characterized by positive (delta C-13(earb) excursion of around +5 parts per thousand. Since the Fanhe Group was usually considered as Meso-Neoproterozoic in ages, the reasons for positive (delta C-13(earb) excursions in the lower Fanhe Group are unclear. Our new LA-(MC-)ICP-MS U-Pb dating on a dolerite sill intruding into the Guanmenshan Formation yields two upper intercept Pb-207/Pb-206 ages of 2065 + 20 Ma (95% confidence, MSWD = 1.4, N = 26) and 2062 +/- 22 Ma (95% confidence, MSWD = 1.05, N = 22), respectively. Combined with the weighted mean Pb-207/Pb-206 age of the youngest detrital zircon population of the Daposhan Formation (2199 +/- 19 Ma, 95% confidence, N = 8, MSWD = 0.47) and their contact relations, the deposition ages of the Daposhan, Kangzhaungzi, Guanmenshan and Tongjiajie formations from the lower part of Fanhe Group were constrained to be Rhyacian Period from ca. 2200 Ma to ca. 2060 Ma, not Mesoproterozoic Era as previously regarded. These new age constraints provide solid evidence for the existence of weakly metamorphosed stratigraphic records of GOE and LJE in lower part of Fanhe Group in the NCC. Stratigraphic correlations with other ancient cratons show that the Guanmenshan Formation in Fanhe Basin in the northeastern NCC can be correlated with the Dashiling Formation of the Hutuo Group in the central NCC, the Lucknow Formation in West Australia, the Upper Pretoria Formation in South Africa, the Gordon Lake Formation in North America and the Tulomozero and Kuetsjarvi formations in Fennoscandia, and therefore the Fanhe Group provides excellent stratigraphic records to study GOE and LJE in the NCC.},

Zircon U-Pb dating indicates that the protolith of the metasedimentary rock in the Qinling Group was deposited later than similar to 1502Ma. The Qinling Group in the NQB represents a long-lived unit, and its formation age can be constrained to the period between the Paleoproterozoic and early Neoproterozoic. The zircon age populations of the studied sample can be divided into two major populations of 1559-1642 and 1470-1548Ma, and one subordinate population of 1717-1794Ma, indicating their provenances were mainly attributed to the NQB and subordinately from the North China Craton (NCC) and the Yangtze Craton (YZC). And the distribution of the early Neoproterozoic magmatic events and the Nd-Pb whole-rock isotopes, zircon Hf isotopes, and trace element compositions of the Precambrian basement rocks in the NQB is significantly different from those in the NCC and YZC, indicating that the NQB cannot be a southern sector of the NCC, or a northern sector of the YZC, and was an independent microcontinent from the Paleoproterozoic to the early Neoproterozoic.},

   abstract = {The Changchun-Yanji suture zone is composed of a sequence of high-pressure metamorphic rocks. It lies to the southern margin of the Jilin-Heilongjiang high-pressure metamorphic belt and separates the Jiamusi-Khanka Block to the north from the North China Craton. In this study, to understand the nature of the Changchun-Yanji suture zone, we studied four samples in diverse lithology (i.e., two chlorite schists, one felsic dike sample, and one piemontite schist) from the Yantongshan Complex. These rocks have been intensely deformed without preservation of original sedimentary features. Integrated evidence from high-pressure metamorphic minerals and zircon U-Pb age results suggests that most of the Paleozoic strata in this region might be part of a tectonic melange. Phengite in the piemontite schist contains high Si (>= 3.304 based on 11 oxygens), indicative of high-pressure metamorphism. The piemontite schist contains 6 zircon age populations from 2505 +/- 40 to 231 +/- 10 Ma. The 22 youngest zircon grains define a weighted mean age of 237 +/- 5 Ma, placing an upper limit on the depositional time of the protolith of the piemontite schist. The felsic dike intruded into the metasedimentary rocks gave concordant ages with a weighted mean age of 217 +/- 5 Ma, providing a minimum emplacement age for the Yantongshan Complex. We conclude from these data that the final collision between the Jiamusi-Khanka Block and North China Craton along the Changchun-Yanji suture zone occurred before the Late Triassic. Moreover, this closure time is at least 30 Myr later than closure along the Solonker-Xar Moron suture in the late Permian. As such, we consider that the Changchun-Yanji suture zone was not related to amalgamation of the Siberian and North China cratons, but was the result of the subduction of the Paleo-Pacific Plate.},

   abstract = {How and when the northwestern Tibetan Plateau originated and developed upon pre-existing crustal and topographic features is not well understood. To address this question, we present an integrated analysis of detrital zircon U-Pb and fission-track double dating of Cenozoic synorogenic sediments from the Kekeya and Sanju sections in the southwestern Tarim Basin. These data help establishing a new chronostratigraphic framework for the Sanju section and confirm a recent revision of the chronostratigraphy at Kekeya. Detrital zircon fission-track ages present prominent Triassic-Early Jurassic (similar to 250-170 Ma) and Early Cretaceous (similar to 130-100 Ma) static age peaks, and Paleocene-Early Miocene (similar to 60-21 Ma) to Eocene-Late Miocene (similar to 39-7 Ma) moving age peaks, representing source exhumation. Triassic-Early Jurassic static peak ages document unroofing of the Kunlun terrane, probably related to the subduction of Paleotethys oceanic lithosphere. In combination with the occurrence of synorogenic sediments on both flanks of the Kunlun terrane, these data suggest that an ancient West Kunlun range had emerged above sea level by Triassic-Early Jurassic times. Early Cretaceous fission-track peak ages are interpreted to document exhumation related to thrusting along the Tam Karaul fault, kinematically correlated to the Main Pamir thrust further west. Widespread Middle-Late Mesozoic crustal shortening and thickening likely enhanced the Early Mesozoic topography. Paleocene-Early Eocene fission-track peak ages are presumably partially reset. Limited regional exhumation indicates that the Early Cenozoic topographic and crustal pattern of the West Kunlun may be largely preserved from the Middle-Late Mesozoic. The Main Pamir-Tam Karaul thrust belt could be a first-order tectonic feature bounding the northwestern margin of the Middle-Late Mesozoic to Early Cenozoic Tibetan Plateau. Toward the Tarim basin, Late Oligocene-Early Miocene steady exhumation at a rate of similar to 0.9 km/Myr is likely related to initial thrusting of the Tiklik fault and reactivation of the Tam Karaul thrust. Thrusting together with upper crustal shortening in the mountain front indicates basinward expansion of the West Kunlun orogen at this time. This episode of exhumation and uplift, associated with magmatism across western Tibet, is compatible with a double-sided lithospheric wedge model, primarily driven by breakoff of the Indian crustal slab. Accelerated exhumation of the mountain front at a rate of similar to 1.1 km/Myr since similar to 15 Ma supports active compressional deformation at the margins of the northwestern Tibetan Plateau. We thus propose that the West Kunlun Mountains are a long-lived topographic unit, dating back to Triassic-Early Jurassic times, and have experienced Middle-Late Mesozoic to Early Cenozoic rejuvenation and Late Oligocene-Miocene expansion.

   abstract = {The complex sedimentary processes from source to sink lead to a substantial fractionation of sediment size and composition. Relatively coarse-grained, continent-derived detritus is rarely transported and deposited in the deep ocean, and the terminus of this sediment routing system is poorly understood. Sandy turbidite deposits within the Upper Miocene-Pleistocene strata drilled in the deep central South China Sea during the International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Expedition 349 provide valuable samples for evaluating the evolution of sediment contributions from different Asian landmasses. This study reconstructs this ancient source-to-sink system based on an integration of heavy mineral and detrital zircon analyses (including U-Pb age, trace element, grain size and shape), obtained from IODP sites U1431 and U1432, as well as a zircon age-based mixture modeling of well-defined provenance end-members. The results show several provenance shifts that correspond to more complex and dynamic source-to-sink scenarios than previously envisaged. Certain source areas, like East Vietnam, present a different provenance signature than that of today. Multiple provenances have been mixed and diluted during sediment transport, exhibiting a large regional variability. We interpret that siliciclastic turbidite deposits in the central South China Sea were mainly derived from East Vietnam during the early Late Miocene and Pliocene, and the Pearl River Basin during the late Late Miocene and Pleistocene. Additional, but less significant, contributions from the Red and Mekong river basins and coastal Southeast China are also observed.},

   abstract = {Understanding the paradoxical presence of extensive low-relief surfaces perched above deep valleys in SE Tibet is a long-standing challenge. Its origin, based on topographic analysis, has been explained traditionally by incision of a regional relict landscape or, more recently, by in situ formation in response to drainage area loss feedback. Here we apply a qualitative and quantitative source-to-sink approach to test whether either of the two mechanisms may apply by establishing potential links among detrital zircon provenance of the Oligocene-Miocene Pearl River Mouth Basin, drainage evolution of the Pearl River, and low-relief, high-elevation surface formation in the SE Tibetan Plateau margin. Our zircon record, combined with previous geochemical records from the northern South China Sea, confirms a significant Late Oligocene provenance shift, represented by an intensive addition of Proterozoic zircons and a gradual negative excursion in Nd isotopes. We interpret this provenance shift as a response to a progressive drainage expansion of the Pearl River, evolving from relatively small rivers confined to coastal South China in the Early Oligocene to a near-modern continental-scale drainage configuration in the Early Miocene, which may be correlated with an earlier surface uplift of SE Tibet than previously thought. This westward expansion process of the Pearl River favors the envisaged drainage evolution of the relict landscape model over that of the drainage area loss feedback model, suggesting that the Middle-Late Cenozoic low-relief, high-elevation surface formation in SE Tibet may be readily interpreted as preserving past tectonic and environmental conditions.

   abstract = {Detrital zircons of five sandstones were analysed based on their laser ablation multi-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry uranium-lead (U-Pb) ages and their morphological features to reveal the provenance of the Lower Cretaceous Duwon Formation in Goheung, Korea. A total of 495 valid analytical points were obtained from zircon U-Pb dating, and in terms of age distribution, there were 361 Precambrian zircons (ca. 73%), nine Palaeozoic zircons (ca. 2%) and 125 Mesozoic zircons (ca. 25%). Except for 16 Cretaceous zircons, most were interpreted to be derived from the Yeongnam Massif and the southwestern Okcheon Basin located in the area to the northwest or west of the Duwon Formation. However, the Cretaceous zircons (ca. 127-118 Ma), which accounted for-3% of all zircons, were formed during the magmatic quiescence in the Korean Peninsula, making it difficult to interpret their prove-nance at this time. This period coincided with active igneous activities in eastern China due to the low-angle subduction of the Palaeo-Pacific plate. In addition, westerlies were dominant due to the atmo-spheric general circulation. From morphological analysis of the zircons, Cretaceous zircons were smaller in size than those from other ages and generally had good sphericity and a euhedral shape. The overall evidence suggests the possibility that predominant westerly winds supplied Cretaceous zircons to the Korean Peninsula during explosive volcanic eruptions in eastern China during the Early Cretaceous. However, further studies are needed to clarify this hypothesis. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {The age distribution of detrital zircon has been used to trace sediment sources. Existing datasets show great similarity of zircon ages between the loess on the Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP) and the sediments from the North Tibetan Plateau (NTP), implying that eolian dust is delivered from the NTP to the CLP by westerly winds or via the Yellow River. However, NTP dust can also be transported by northwesterly winds from the Alxa arid lands (AALs), where materials are received from both the NTP and the Gobi Altay Mountains (GAMs). Here we report U-Pb zircon ages for AALs sands and NTP and CLP loess. The results show that the zircons in the AALs are mixed from NTP and GAMs zircons. NTP loess is mainly derived from local sources. Mixing of materials from the NTP and GAMs defines the zircon ages of the loess on the CLP better than the pure NTP source. No temporal and spatial heterogeneities of zircon ages have been observed for the loess on the CLP, which suggests that the well-mixed materials in the AALs likely have an eolian source.

We apply an integrated analysis of stratigraphy, petrography, and U-Pb dates and Hf isotopes on detrital zircons to investigate its provenance and relationships to the progressive collisions that formed the Xing'an-Mongolia Orogenic Belt to the north and the Qinling Orogenic Belt to the south. The results show that, in addition to regional patterns of siliciclastic influx from these new uplifted sources, the Benxi Formation is composed of two sequences corresponding to long-term glacial-interglacial cycles during the Moscovian to lower Gzhelian stages which drove global changes of eustatic sea level and weathering. The spatio-temporal distribution of sediment isopachs and facies indicate there were two sediment-infilling pulses, during which the southern and the northern Ordos Basin developed tidal-reworked deltas. The age spectra from detrital zircons, trace element patterns and epsilon(Hf)(t) values reveal that the siliciclastics forming the southern delta was sourced in the Qinling Orogenic Belt, whereas the northern delta was derived from the Xing'an-Mongolia Orogenic Belt. The source-to-sink evolution of this Upper Paleozoic system records the progressive development of orogenic belts and uplifts forming on the southern and northern margins of the NCB prior to its collisions with the South China and the Siberian plates, respectively.},

   abstract = {The Wudaogou Group in eastern Yanbian, Northeast China, plays a key role in constraining the timing and eastward termination of the Solonker-Xra Moron River-Changchun Suture, where the Palaeo-Asian Ocean closed. The Wudaogou Group consists of schist, gneiss, amphibolite, metasedimentary, and metavolcanic rocks, all of which underwent greenschist- to epidote-amphibolite-facies regional metamorphism, with some hornfels resulting from contact metamorphism. To determine the age of deposition, the timing and grade of metamorphism, and the tectonic setting of the Wudaogou Group, we investigated the petrography and geochronology of the metamorphic rocks in this group. Zircons from the metasedimentary rocks of this group can be divided into metamorphic zircons and detrital zircons of magmatic origin. U-Pb ages of metamorphic zircons dated by LA-ICP-MS vary from 249 +/- 4 to 266 +/- 4Ma, approximating the age of regional metamorphism in the eastern Yanbian area. Detrital zircons yield U-Pb ages ranging from 253 +/- 5 to 818 +/- 5Ma, and indicate that the provenance of the Wudaogou Group experienced four tectonic-thermal events between 818 and 253Ma: Neoproterozoic (ca. 818-580Ma), Cambro-Ordovician (ca. 500-489Ma), Devonian-Carboniferous (ca. 422-300Ma), and middle-late Permian (ca. 269-253Ma). The youngest detrital zircon, with a U-Pb age of 253 +/- 5Ma, defines the maximum depositional age of the Wudaogou Group. The presence of the Cambro-Ordovician and Neoproterozoic detrital zircons implies that the source of the Wudaogou Group had an affinity with Northeast China, which leads us to conclude that the Solonker-Xra Moron River-Changchun Suture extends from Wangqing to Hunchun in eastern Yanbian, and that the Palaeo-Asian Ocean may have closed at the end of the Permian or Early Triassic period.},

   abstract = {Geohistory of the Yunkai massif in South China Block is important in understanding the geodynamics for the build-up of this block during the Phanerozoic orogenies. To investigate this massif, we conduct EMP monazite and U-Pb zircon geochronological determinations on mineral inclusions and separate for seventeen samples in four groups, representing metamorphic rocks from core domain, the Gaozhou Complex (amphibolite fades, NE-striking) and the Yunkai Group (greenschist fades, NW-striking) of this massif and adjacent undeformed granites. Some EMP monazite ages are consistent with the NanoSIMS results. Monazite inclusions, mostly with long axis parallel to the cleavage of platy and elongated hosts, give distinguishable age results for NW-and NE-trending deformations at 244-236 Ma and 236-233 Ma, respectively. They also yield ages of 233-230 Ma for core domain gneissic granites and 232-229 Ma for undefomed granites. Combining U-Pb zircon ages of the same group, similar to 245 Ma and similar to 230 Ma are suggested to constrain the time of two phases of deformation. Aside from ubiquity of Triassic ages in studied rocks, ages of detrital monazite in the meta-sandstone match the major U-Pb zircon age clusters of the metamorphic rock that are largely concentrated at Neoproterozoic (1.0-0.9 Ga) and Early Paleozoic (444-431 Ma). Based on these geochronological data, Triassic is interpreted as representing the time for recrystallization of these host minerals on the Early Paleozoic protolith, and the also popular Neoproterozoic age is probably inherited. With this context, Yunkai massif is regarded as a strongly reactivated Triassic metamorphic terrain on an Early Paleozdic basement which had incorporated sediments with Neoproterozoic provenances. Triassic tectonic evolution of the Yunkai massif is suggested to have been controlled by converging geodynamics of the South China and Indochina Blocks as well as mafic magma emplacement related to the Emeishan large igneous province (E-LIP).

   abstract = {The provenance of sediments in western Taiwan has been the subject of debate in recent years. Previous investigators, solely based on the U-Pb zircon geochronology for the detrital grains, all advocated the important roles, but with varying emphasis, of drainage systems in the South China Block. Influence of the Changjiang (Yangtze) River from the far-source Yangtze block versus nearby systems like Zhujiang, Minjiang and Jiulongjiang Rivers in the Cathaysia block has been the main issue. However, the fundamental question of whether the provenance is really the South China Block has never been evaluated. Here we report both the U-Pb zircon and Electron MicroProbe (EMP) monazite age data for seven sediment samples from two sides of the Taiwan Strait and synthesize the published data for all these rivers and sedimentary strata in western Taiwan to tackle this problem. The lack of, or insufficient, similar to 1.8 Ga monazites in the sediments of river mouths for all drainage systems in the South China Block makes them unlikely to be the source of Miocene sediments in western Taiwan where similar to 1.8 Ga monazite grains occupy 14.5-33.3% of the total age population. With reference to the tectonic evolution of the coastal southeast China-Taiwan region during Early Cretaceous to recent time, we propose a new explanation that invokes a now-concealed microcontinent along the Manila Trench. This microcontinent, probably related to a Paleoproterozoic orogen in Gondwana, eventually collided with the South China Block causing uplift of the easternmost structural element the Pingtan-Dongshan Metamorphic Belt (PDMB) at ca. 130-120 Ma. It then drifted away sometime after 100 Ma and split into two parts with one becoming today's Palawan-Mindoro terrain of the Philippines. As indicated by the geophysical data near southern Taiwan, the remainder of this split microcontinent had subducted underneath the Philippine Sea plate along Manila Trench as a result of the opening of the South China Sea at similar to 33 Ma. Both the Peikang and Kuanyin basement highs in the offshore western Taiwan represent the unsubducted remnants of this microcontinent and also the major suppliers of Late Oligocene-Miocene sediments in western Taiwan. On the other hand, the Eocene-Early Oligocene strata of the Hsuehshan Range in central Taiwan show both zircon and monazite age patterns resembling the Eocene-Early Oligocene and recent sediments of the Zhujiang drainage system, indicating the southwestern origin of the protolith Taiwan. This scenario also matches the recent proposition that part of the Central Range belongs to the deep-level accretionary prism of a Miocene subduction system.},

   abstract = {The Baoshan Block in western Yunnan is one of the major micro-continents in the eastern Tethyan orogenic belt, but its provenance and crustal evolution remain enigmatic. Sedimentary rocks prior to an amalgamation of continental blocks recorded key information about crustal evolution and the origin of terranes and can provide vital data for understanding orogenic processes. Here, we present U-Pb ages and Hf isotopic data on detrital zircon and Nd isotopic data on whole rock for Paleozoic sedimentary rocks from the Baoshan Block to constrain their provenance and tectonic history. Crystallization ages of detrital zircon grains illustrate that the magmatic activities of the source areas occurred at similar to 2.5 Ga, similar to 1.9 Ga, and similar to 1.0-0.5 Ga, with a major peak occurring around 0.95 Ga. Several old zircon grains from >3.0 Ga up to similar to 3.8-3.7 Ga were observed. Zircon Hf isotopic data from one sample suggest that the major crustal growth occurred at similar to 2.1 Ga. Cambrian to Carboniferous sedimentary rocks showed similar Nd isotopic features with two-stage Nd model ages of approximately 2.1 Ga. The age distribution patterns and isotopic data suggest that detritus material in the Paleozoic sedimentary rocks was mainly derived from continental terrane similar to the Indian craton, implying that the Baoshan Block was likely adjacent to Northwest India before the collision of the Baoshan and Simao blocks. No significant inputs of the juvenile crust were documented in the Nd-Hf isotopic data, appearing to be incompatible with a magmatic arc setting for the Baoshan Block during the Paleozoic. This block might have been situated at the interior of Gondwana before rifting and drifting northwards to the Eurasia continent.},

   abstract = {Deep-water canyon systems can provide important sandstone reservoirs for deep-water oil and gas exploration in the South China Sea; however, the sedimentary provenance of the Central Canyon in the Qiongdongnan Basin remains controversial. In this work, detrital zircon grains from three drilling sandstones in the Upper Miocene Huangliu Formation in the western part of the Central Canyon were analysed by LA-ICP-MS for U-Pb ages, in order to constrain their provenance. One hundred and ninety-one zircon grains yield concordant U-Pb ages ranging from 28.6 to 3285 Ma. Most of them show oscillatory or linear zoning in CL-images and high Th/U ratios (> 0.1), suggesting that they are magmatic zircons. Three major age clusters at about 30 Ma (N=6), 220-270 Ma (N=29), and 420-440 Ma (N=13), and five minor age clusters at 70-110 Ma (N=7), 150-170 Ma (N=4), 800-850 Ma (N=11), 1800-2000 Ma (N=16), and 2400-2600 Ma (N=7), can be identified in the age spectrum, which are very similar to those of the Upper Miocene sandstones and modern river sands in the Red River area, but different from those of other nearby regions (e.g., Hainan Island, the Pearl River area, and the Mekong River area) in Southeast Asia. The major age peak at about 30 Ma in our samples is consistent with the timing of tectonothermal events in the Red River Fault Zone. Therefore, we suggest that the provenance of the western part of the Central Canyon, in the Qiongdongnan Basin, was fed dominantly by the Paleo-Red River system during the Late Miocene.},

   abstract = {The Kuhai-Saishitang area, which can be divided into the Tongyugou-Saishitang and southern Kuhai areas, is located in the northeastern Tibetan Plateau. Numerous Cu deposits have been discovered in the Tongyugou-Saishitang area, with the ore-forming materials being derived from both sedimentary rocks and igneous intrusions. In contrast, no deposits have been found in the southern Kuhai area. The mineralization potential in the southern Kuhai area remains unclear. We collected a siltstone sample from the Tongyugou-Saishitang area and a sandstone sample from the southern Kuhai area for zircon LA-ICP-MS U-Pb dating, which yielded the youngest ages of 228 and 277 Ma, respectively. The samples exhibit similar age spectra, suggesting that these rocks have a common source. Detrital zircons from the samples can be divided into five groups on the basis of their U-Pb ages: Early Mesozoic-Late Palaeozoic (228-335 Ma), Early Palaeozoic (372-565 Ma), Neoproterozoic (645-995 Ma), Mesoproterozoic (1,154-1,693 Ma), and Paleoproterozoic-Neoarchaean (1,827-3,128 Ma). On the basis of a detailed comparison of the age spectra with those in the adjacent regions, we propose that the sedimentary rocks of the Kuhai-Saishitang area have an identical provenance that was derived mainly from the northern margin of the Qaidam Basin during the Middle-Late Triassic. The southern Kuhai area is also a potential target for further Cu exploration.},

   abstract = {The tectonic evolution of the Qinling orogen, central China, is the key to understanding the assembly of the SinoKorean and Yangtze cratons. The Wuguan complex, between the early Paleozoic North Qinling and Mesozoic South Qinling tectonic belts, can provide important constraints on the late Paleozoic evolutionary processes in the Qinling orogen. U-Pb zircon analyses, using laser ablation-multicollector-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry, reveal protolith ages of 446 +/- 2 Ma for a garnet amphibolite, 368 +/- 3 Ma for a meta-andesite, and 351 +/- 2 Ma for a mylonitized granitic dike from the Wuguan complex. Elemental geochemistry indicates typical island arc affinities for all the above rocks, but some amphibolites of unknown age have E-MORB signatures. Detrital zircons from a metaquartzite have an age spectrum with a major peak at 462 Ma, two subordinate peaks at 828 and 446 Ma, and a youngest weighted mean age of 423 +/- 5 Ma This suggests that at least some of metasedimentaiy rocks from the Wuguan complex belong to the part of the Devonian turbidite sequence of the Liuling Group, which was deposited in a fore-arc basin along the southern accreted margin of the Sino-Korean craton, whereas the late Ordovician precursors of the amphibolite might be derived from the Danfeng Group. The occurrence of late Devonian-early Carboniferous arc-related rocks in the Wuguan complex implies penecontemporaneous oceanic subduction, and therefore the Paleo-Qinling Ocean was not finally closed until the early Carboniferous. On the other hand, metamorphic zircon grains from two amphibolites yielded ages of 321 +/- 2 and 318 +/- 3 Ma. Hence, the Wuguan complex in the Qinling orogen and the Guishan complex in the Tongbai orogen constitute a medium-pressure Carboniferous metamorphic belt that is more than 500 km long, and which was formed in the hanging wall of a subduction zone.

   abstract = {An integrated U-Pb and Hf-isotope study on detrital zircons from the early Paleozoic meta-sedimentary rocks along the Chalysh-Terekta-Ulagan-Sayan suture zone in Russian Altai was conducted in order to trace their provenance and tectonic setting. Most of the zircons possess oscillatory zoning and high Th/U ratios (>0.1), indicating their magmatic origin. The investigated samples yield similar zircon populations, i.e., dominant groups with late Neoproterozoic to early Paleozoic ages, followed by those from Mesoproterozoic to late Neoproterozoic and minor ones from Archean to middle Mesoproterozoic, indicating multiple tectono-thermal events in the source area. Comparison with surrounding tectonic units shows that the Tuva-Mongolian terrane and its adjacent island arcs possibly provided substantial materials to the sedimentary basin. These rocks show detrital zircon age patterns and Hf-isotope compositions similar to their counterparts in the Chinese Altai and Tseel terrane in western Mongolia, but different from those in the Gomy Altai terrane. Therefore, the investigated metasedimentary units possibly represented the northernmost segment of the Altai-Mongolian terrane. With combination of previous studies in the Chinese Altai and Tseel terrane, our data suggest that the Altai-Mongolian terrane possibly represents a coherent continental arc-accretionary prism system built upon the active margin of the western Mongolia during the Cambrian to Ordovician and thus does not support the micro-continent model with a passive margin. A compilation of U-Pb and Hf-isotope data of detrital zircons from the whole Altai-Mongolian terrane shows that the source area (i.e., the western Mongolia) underwent two most extensive magmatic activities at ca. 1.02-0.67 Ga and 0.67-0.43 Ga. These zircons possess both positive and negative epsilon(Hf)(t) values, suggesting significant crustal growth and reworking during the magmatic activities. Our study underlines a crucial role of Precambrian micro-continents (e.g., the Tuva-Mongolian terrane) and island arcs surrounding them in the formation of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt.

   abstract = {The Quanji Massif is a cratonic fragment located on the northeastern margin of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau in western Qinghai Province, northwest China (Fig. 1). This massif consists of pre-Neoproterozoic crystalline basement unconformably overlain by mid- to late-Neoproterozoic and Cambrian strata. The basement is dominantly made up of the Delingha complex and the supracrustal Dakendaban Group. The Delingha complex is made up of 2.24-2.39 Ga granitic gneisses with enclaves of dominant amphibolite and minor felsic gneisses as well as granulites. The supracrustal Dakendaban group is in tectonic contact with the Delingha Complex, and can be divided into the lower and upper Dakendaban sub-Groups. Data from detrital zircons show that the protolith rocks of these two sub-groups were deposited after similar to 2.32 Ga, and similar to 2.11 Ga, respectively. The detrital zircon age and Hf isotopic data and geological correlations suggest that the Quanji Massif was possibly fragmented from the Tarim Craton, and the Delingha complex was probably uplifted to become the major sedimentary source for the upper Dakendaban sub-group at similar to 2.11 Ga. Our zircon Hf-isotope compositions demonstrate important crustal growth at 2.6-2.7 Ga and similar to 2.5 Ga. Together with the important magmatic activity at similar to 2.2-2.4 Ga and geological data, our results seem to suggest that the Tarim Craton was part of the North China Craton in its early evolutionary history but rifted away and joined the Yangtze Craton prior to the Neoproterozoic.

   abstract = {The relationship of the Yangtze Block with other continental blocks of the Rodinia and Gondwana supercontinents is hotly debated. Here we report U-Pb and Lu-Hf isotopic data for zircons from the latest Neoproterozoic Yanjing Group and the overlying Silurian-Devonian rocks on the western margin of Yangtze Block, which provide critical constraints on the provenance of these sediments and further shed light on the crustal evolution and tectonic affinity of the western Yangtze Block in the context of Rodinia and the subsequent Gondwanaland. Mica schist from the middle part of the Yanjing Group contains dominant Neoproterozoic detrital zircons (0.72-0.80 Ga) with a pronounced age peak at 0.75 Ga. Based on the euhedral to subhedral shapes, high Th/U ratios and exclusively positive epsilon Hf(t) values(+6 to +14) for the zircon crystals, and the lack of ancient zircons, we consider the sediments as products of proximal deposition near a Neoproterozoic subduction system in western Yangtze. Combined with the age of rhyolite from the lower part of the Yanjing Group, these strata were estimated to have been deposited in a period between 0.72 and 0.63 Ga. In contrast, the Silurian-Devonian sediments exhibit dominant Grenvillian ages (0.9-1.0 Ga), with middle Neoproterozoic (0.73-0.85 Ga), Pan-African (0.49-0.67 Ga) and Neoarchean (similar to 2.5 Ga) age populations, suggesting a significant change of sedimentary provenance and thus a different tectonic setting. Although the shift occurred in the Silurian, the age spectra turn to be consistent along the western margin of the Yangtze Block until the Devonian, indicating persistence of the same sedimentary environment. However, the related provenance of these Paleozoic sediments cannot be found in South China. The presence of abundant Grenvillian, Pan-African and Neoarchean ages, along with their moderately to highly rounded shapes, indicates the possibility of exotic continental terrane(s) as a possible sedimentary provenance. Considering the potential source areas around the Yangtze Block when it was part of the Rodinia or Gondwana, we suggest that the source of these Paleozoic sediments had typical Gondwana affinities such as the Himalaya region, north India, which is also supported by their stratigraphic similarity, newly published paleomagnetic data and the tectono-thermal events of northwestern fragments of Gondwana. This implies that after a prolonged subduction in the Neoproterozoic, the western margin of the Yangtze Block began to incorporate into the assembly of the Gondwana supercontinent and was able to accept sediments from northwestern margin of Gondwanaland as a result of early Paleozoic orogeny.

   abstract = {Neoproterozoic to Paleozoic sedimentation shows systematic temporal-spatial variations within South China, which must be considered in reconstructing geological evolution of South China in response to global plate reorganization from the breakup of Rodinia to the assembly of Gondwana. We use >1000 new U-Pb and Hf isotopic data for detrital zircons from NeoproterozoicCambrian strata across the western (i.e., Longmenshan) and eastern (i.e., Wuyishan) margins of South China, coupled with compiled stratigraphic and magmatic information, to constrain change in provenance through time. First-order conclusions are as follows: (1) detrital zircons from the Neoproterozoic strata of the two margins were mainly sourced from the Panxi-Hannan arc and the Jiangnan orogen, signaling a rough self-sufficient sedimentary system; (2) newly identified Cambrian molasse-like sediments in the western margin, in which abundant detrital zircons are 550-500 Ma old with positive epsilon(Hf)(t) values, were mainly derived from the 580-500 Ma Cadomian arc belt along the Iran-Turkey margin; and (3) the Cambrian sediments in the eastern margin document more increased contributions from the Grenvillian-age provinces most possibly in Australia. Such spatial-temporal provenance variations signal the northward drifting of South China, from a position connecting with Iran-Turkey and northern India to that approaching Australia during the late Neoproterozoic-Cambrian period. We highlight that the activity of oblique oceanic-continental convergence accreted Asian terranes onto the northern margin of Gondwana, hence contributing to the ultimate Gondwana architecture under global plate reorganization.},

   abstract = {Detrital minerals are important recorders of sedimentary transport and provenance, both of which have significant implications for basin genesis and tectonics. By integrating detrital zircon U-Pb dating and Lu-Hf isotopic analyses, quantitative mineralogy of heavy minerals, and paleocurrent analysis, we identified here two Late Paleozoic provenance shifts in the east-central Ordos Basin, North China. The Late Paleozoic sandstones in the Liulin section of the Ordos Basin reveal detrital zircon U-Pb age peaks at 2.5 Ga, 1.85 Ga and 0.3 Ga. The ca. 0.41-0.42 Ga age populations are observed in the late Carboniferous Benxi Formation and late Permian Shiqianfeng Formation, respectively, yet are missing in the early-middle Permian Taiyuan, Shanxi and Shihezi Formations. The Precambrian detrital zircons show highly variable Lu-Hf isotopic compositions, with epsilon Hf(t) values ranging from negative to positive (-22.1 to +15.5). In contrast, the Phanerozoic detrital zircons present enriched Hf isotopic signatures, indicating magma sources with considerable ancient crustal components. Combined with heavy minerals and paleocurrent analysis, this study demonstrates that the major sedimentary provenance of the early-middle Permian Taiyuan, Shanxi and Shihezi Formations was the Yinshan orogenic belt. Sedimentary provenance for the late Carboniferous Benxi Formation and late Permian Shiqianfeng Formation could have been the Yinshan orogenic belt and the southern margin of the North China Craton (NCC). The first early Permian provenance shift may have been initiated by the uplift of the Yinshan orogenic belt, while the uplift of the southern margin of the NCC (associated with the Qinling orogenic belt), might have precipitated the second shift.},

   abstract = {The Palawan microcontinental block is thought to have separated from the South China margin due to seafloor spreading and opening of the South China Sea. However, it is uncertain when and from which section the Palawan microcontinental block rifted from the South China margin and little is known about sediment routing across the rifted margin before continental breakup. To address these aspects, we studied the biostratigraphy and provenance of syn-rift sedimentary rocks collected from the Panas-Pandian Formation in central-southern Palawan. Micropaleontological evidence indicates a Middle Eocene-earliest Oligocene (47.7-32.9 Ma) age for the Panas-Pandian Formation. Based on this and the oldest age of the post-rift Nido Limestone (similar to 32 Ma), the breakup unconformity on the Palawan microcontinent block is dated around 33-32 Ma. This timing of breakup unconformity is close to that of the Pearl River Mouth Basin (similar to 30 Ma) and IODP Site U1435 (similar to 34 Ma), suggesting a conjugate relationship between the Palawan microcontinental block and the Pearl River Mouth Basin. Trace fossils and benthic foraminifera from the Panas-Pandian Formation indicate a middle bathyal to abyssal environment on the continental slope of the South China margin. Multidisciplinary provenance analysis reveals that the Panas-Pandian Formation was derived from both local Mesozoic basement uplifts and the interior Cathaysia Block. It indicates that a paleo-Pearl River has been established at least since the Middle Eocene (47.7-42.1 Ma) and could deliver sediments from the interior Cathaysia Block to the continental slope, across the wide rifted margin with a low topographic gradient.},

   abstract = {The Yuli metamorphic belt has been the topic of petrological and geochronological studies for over 40 years and has been interpreted as a Cretaceous melange. Our study utilizes zircon U-Pb dating of schist and exotic blueschist blocks in the Yuli belt. These new ages indicate that these metamorphic rocks are actually middle Miocene in age and may represent the deeper structural levels of an accretionary prism. Several distinctive detrital zircon U-Pb age populations are recognized from 14 siliceous schists of melange-hosted rocks that are similar in age population to the Cretaceous, Eocene-Oligocene, and Miocene strata of Taiwan. The wide range of ages is interpreted as a product mixing of various sedimentary strata prior to metamorphism. Three blueschists of a volcanic-arc protolith enclosed within the host rocks yield crystallization ages of 15.4 +/- 0.4, 15.5 +/- 0.3, and 16.0 +/- 0.2 Ma based on zircon U-Pb dating. In consideration of the new data regarding the Cretaceous-Miocene host rocks and the middle Miocene exotic blueschist blocks, it strongly suggests that the Yuli belt formed at deeper levels of an accretionary wedge during subduction of South China Sea oceanic crust at the middle-late Miocene. Subsequently, the rapid uplift of the metamorphic belt was probably related to doubly vergent wedge extrusion due to the Pliocene arc-continent collision.},

U-Pb dating of 170 detrital zircons defines five major age populations at 459-545 Ma, 710-900 Ma, 1,300-900 Ma, 1,814-1,641 Ma, and 2,153-2,845 Ma, demonstrating that the black rock units deposited during the Late Ordovician and the tectonic events that occurred in the West Kunlun Orogen were related to the assembly and breakup of the supercontinents of Columbia and Rodinia. Prevalence of Early Palaeozoic magmatic zircons further indicates the black rock units were derived from a proximal source, most likely from the South Kunlun arc.},

   abstract = {Late Neoproterozoic extensive rifting in Tarim has been intensely debated regarding an intracontinental or a back-arc environment, which forms a key aspect for elucidating the Precambrian basement architecture and evolution of the Tarim craton. Recently, a deep well called Tarim Geological Survey Well (X1) was drilled from the northwest Tarimbasin. Sixty-six samples were collected from the Sugetbrak Formation of the X1 well, including 6 sandstone samples, 29 mudstone samples and 31 basalt samples, for integrated geochemical, geochronological, and Sr-Nd-Hf isotopic analyses. The results indicate that the basalts geochemically show distinct affinity with ocean-island basalts, characterized by enrichments in light rare-earth elements (REEs) and no depletions in Nb and Ta and indicating an intracontinental rifting environment. The presence of 572-Ma zircon in the Sugetbrak basalts reveal the rifting mainly developed in an interval of 541-572 Ma. Geochemical and petrographic data show that the coeval basaltic tuffs or clasts contributed 5-20% to the deposition of the Sugetbrak Formation. The zircon age cluster between 1.8 and 2.0 Ga and abundant Paleoproterozoic detrital zircons with ultrahigh-temperature (UHT) granulate REE signature in the Sugetbrak sandstones indicate a Paleoproterozoic orogenic event occurred in the Tarimcraton that could be related to the assembly of the Columbia supercontinent. In contrast, the Neoproterozoic zircons from the Sugetbrak sandstones display positive epsilon(Hf)(t) values, and some have hydrothermal alteration REE signature, indicating Tarim could be a locus for early mantle plume activities that broke the Rodina supercontinent.

   abstract = {The tectonic evolution of the Chinese Tianshan Belt which is located in the southern margin of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt remains controversial. In order to reveal the evolutionary history of this belt, we investigate metasedimentary rocks from the Tianshanmiao of Harlik domain and Xingxingxia area of central Tianshan domain in this study. The Permian siltstones from Xingxingxia contain six zircon populations with ages peak at 280, 815 and 910, 1590, 1855 and 2340 Ma, suggesting a diverse provenance. The 2544-2294 Ma ages correlate with the generation of continental nuclei in Tarim. The tectonothermal events during 1855, 1590, 910 and 815 Ma may correspond to the assembly and breakup of the Columbia and Rodinia supercontinents, respectively. Similar Precambrian age spectra and "event signature" curves suggest that the central Tianshan was most likely a part of the Tarim block in the Proterozoic. The detrital zircon U-Pb ages of Ordovician meta-greywackes from the Tianshanmiao sequence reveal six zircon populations with peaks at 460, 933, 1382, 1850, 2000 and 2462 Ma, among which the zircons with dominant age peaks (460 Ma and 930 Ma, more than 70%) are euhedral, low sphericity and exhibit clear oscillatory zoning, suggesting local derivation from the proximal Ordovician and Neoproterozoic granitoids. The range of epsilon Hf(t) values (-5.4 to +21) of zircon grains from Ordovician rocks suggests that these were derived from depleted mantle or through partial melting of juvenile crust, similar to the case for the Early Paleozoic magmatism in Chinese Altai. Our detrital zircon data suggest that the provenance of the Harlik was neither the Tarim nor the Junggar, and instead, we propose a connection with the Chinese Altai-Tuva-Mongol Arc along the southern margin of the Siberia craton at similar to 500 Ma. The Harlik domain drifted southward and then collided with the central Tianshan in the Carboniferous-Permian as a result of the closure of Paleo-Tianshan Ocean. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Here we present new detrital zircon U-Pb ages coupled with conglomerate clast counting and sedimentary data from the late Cenozoic Wuheshalu section in the convergence zone, to shed light on the convergence process of the Pamir and South Tian Shan. Large Triassic zircon U-Pb age populations in all seven samples suggest that Triassic igneous rocks from the North Pamir were the major source area for the late Cenozoic Wuheshalu section. In the Miocene, large populations of the North Pamir component supports rapid exhumation in the North Pamir and suggest that topography already existed there since the early Miocene. Exhumation of the South Tian Shan was relatively less important in the Miocene and its detritus could only reach a limited area in the foreland area. Gradually increasing sediment loading and convergence of the Pamir and South Tian Shan caused rapid subsidence in the convergence area. Since ca. 6-5.3 Ma, the combination of a major North Pamir component and a minor South Tian Shan component at the Wuheshalu section is consistent with active deformation of the South Tian Shan and the North Pamir. During deposition of the upper Atushi Formation, a larger proportion of North Pamir-derived sediments was deposited in the Wuheshalu section, maybe because faulting and northward propagation of the North Pamir caused northward displacement of the depocenter to north of the Wuheshalu section.},

In this study, we present results of sandstone petrographic, detrital zircon U similar to Pb, and Cr-spinel geochemical data to determine the provenance of the Mesozoic strata (from the Triassic Quehala Group and the Mid-Jurassic to Lower Cretaceous Xihu, Lagongtang, and Duoni Formations, which are young from similar to 220 Ma to similar to 100 Ma) in this region, thereby allowing for interpretation of their tectonic setting. The similar 1200-900 age cluster from the lower Xihu Formation to that of the Triassic Quehala Group and the distinct age peaks at similar to 200 Ma and similar to 146 Ma from the upper Xihu Formation suggest a Lhasa terrane provenance to the south. Distinctive age clusters of 300-210 Ma and similar to 1800 Ma and Cr-spinel composition analysis of the Lagongtang Formation indicate a provenance shift from the Lhasa terrane to the Qiangtang terrane and the Bangong-Nujiang suture zone to the north. The Lagongtang Formation was deposited in a bathyal-abyssal to shallow-slope environment from north to south, that we interpret as the foredeep depozone and distal foredeep of a peripheral foreland basin system that developed due to flexural subsidence related to the Lhasa-Qiangtang collision and terrane accretion. The age of the Lhasa-Qiangtang collision is constrained by a similar to 140 Ma tuffite U-Pb age at the base of the foreland basin strata. An angular unconformity between the Xihu and Lagongtang Formation, which we interpret as the result of the Lhasa-Qiangtang collision. Our results indicate that the Lhasa-Qiangtang collision initiated around similar to 140 Ma in the Dingqing region, simultaneously with previous determinations 1200 km to the west near Gaize area. Therefore, we prefer quasi-simultaneous onset of collision along-strike to zippering collision models wherein the east collision age is older than the west.},

   abstract = {The Ordos Basin is located in the western part of the North China Craton, and was developed based on Paleozoic shallow marine sediments and Mesozoic continental deposits. In the southwestern Ordos Basin (SWOB), Paleozoic to Mesozoic sedimentary successions are well preserved and display variable deformation. However, the Cretaceous source-to-source evolution of the SWOB is poorly known but is significant to understand the tectonic evolution of the Ordos Basin. In this study, U-Pb ages and Hf isotopic analyses on detrital zircons from sandstones of the Cretaceous succession in the SWOB were performed, with an aim to trace the Cretaceous sediment provenances and the tectonic-paleogeographic configuration of the Ordos Basin. The new analyses clearly reveal four major age peaks for detrital zircons from Cretaceous sedimentary rocks in the SWOB: 274, 438, 1852, and 2474 Ma, and two minor peaks at 880-950 Ma and >3000 Ma. These zircons have epsilon((t))(Hf) values with a normal distribution from -15.8 to 11.4 and T-DM2 ages with multiple peaks mostly at 2985-2720 Ma. Combined with the paleogeographic reconstruction and tectonic evolution of the Ordos Basin, the isotopic analyses prove that the detrital zircons in the Cretaceous succession were mostly sourced from the Alxa Block, Qilian Orogenic Belt, and Yinshan Orogenic Belt, and secondarily from the Qinling Orogenic Belt. Influenced by the formation of the Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous paleo-uplifts, the Cretaceous sedimentary rocks in the SWOB were sourced from these paleo-uplifts and recycled from the underlying pre-Cretaceous rocks situated in the western Ordos Basin. The migration of the Mesozoic sedimentary depocenter and provenance in the Ordos Basin was controlled by the regional compression of multiple directions.},

   abstract = {The Cathaysian Coastal Mountains are thought to be an ancient high-topographic feature that existed along the margin of South China. They are characterised by extensive Jurassic-Cretaceous magmatism; however, their formation mechanism and timing remains uncertain. In this paper, we present sedimentological and detrital zircon analyses from Cretaceous-Eocene strata and drainage sediments from Hainan Island. Our analyses show a change in provenance from a proximal Cathaysian Coastal arc source in Cretaceous strata to a widely distributed intra-island granite source in the Eocene strata and modern river sediments. Reconstruction of the crustal thickness evolution for the South China margin from Eu/Eu*-in-zircon proxy shows significant crustal thickening during the Late Jurassic-Cretaceous, thereby suggesting the existence of the Cathaysian Coastal Mountains. Together with a compilation of detrital zircon U-Pb ages in the northern basins of the South China Sea margin, we conclude that the Cathaysian Coastal Mountains extended from the Red River region to Taiwan along the South China margin during the Late Jurassic-Cretaceous and then collapsed/eroded from northeast to southwest during the Eocene-Miocene. This large mountain range supplied detrital sediments to the marginal basins in the northern South China Sea and formed a topographic barrier that prohibited moist Pacific air to reach the relatively arid inland area of South China during the Late Jurassic-Cretaceous.},

However, their tectonic correlation, affinity and implications have not been well defined. The early to mid-Paleozoic sediments in the northern Alxa area can help to understand this question. These sediments were deposited in a deep to shallow marine environment during a regression. The southeast paleocurrent attributes their provenance to the northwest. Detrital zircons from the collected sandstones record peak ages of approximately 1726 Ma, 1462 Ma, 915 Ma and 438 Ma. The zircon epsilon(Hf)(t) values are negative to positive at 1726 Ma, 915 Ma and 438 Ma, but only positive at 1462 Ma. The detrital zircon U-Pb ages and Hf isotopes suggest the provenance to be the blocks in Central Tianshan and Southern Beishan or their analogs, rather than the Tarim Craton. The source blocks show no tectonic affinity to the Tarim Craton but might be accreted to it in the Neoproterozoic Rodinia. The provenance analyses show tectonic correlation among the northern Alxa, Tianshan and Beishan orogenic belts. The Late Devonian molasse deposits, geochemical shifting to continental margins and suddenly increased early Paleozoic zircons indicate an arc-continent collision. The discovery of more indicators for continental fragments advocates a multiterrane model and dominant crustal reworking/contamination for the tectonocrustal evolution Of the CAOB at least during the early to mid-Paleozoic.

However, its Permo-Carboniferous tectono-palaeogeographic evolution has not been well established. In this study, new zircon U-Pb-Hf isotopic data for the Permo-Carboniferous clastic rocks were used to address the above issue. Based on our dating work and fossil assemblages, we confirmed that the Amushan, Maihanhada, Aqide and Haersuhai formations were formed in the late Carboniferous to early Permian, early to middle Permian, middle Permian and late Permian periods, respectively. The Amushan Formation sandstone in the Zhusileng area contains abundant Palaeozoic zircons (with age peaks at 440 Ma, 475 Ma and 539 Ma) and some Precambrian zircons. These zircon ages and the southeast transgressive direction suggest the provenance to be the local Zhusileng-Hangwula block and the nearby Yagan continental margin. The zircon age pattern with a high proportion of detrital zircons much older than the depositional time and no detrital zircons close to the depositional time suggest an extensional basin depositional setting. The clastic rocks of the Maihanhada, Aqide and Haersuhai formations inherited the source for the Amushan Formation, with a greatly increased input of Permo-Carboniferous volcanic rocks with post-collision or intraplate chemical affinity. Accordingly, a Permo-Carboniferous extensional stage was suggested. Finally, a tectono-palaeogeographic model was reconstructed for the northern Alxa orogenic belt, evolving from a late Carboniferous transgression with crustal extension to early to middle Permian rapid basin filling and a late Permian marine regression.},

   abstract = {The Permo-Carboniferous tectonic setting of the SE Central Asian Orogenic Belt is poorly understood, especially with regard to the development of the Solonker (Suture) Zone. New stratigraphic, geochemical and detrital zircon analyses for Permo-Carboniferous sediments have been undertaken to resolve this problem. In the Mandula area, the Baotege Formation and former Amushan Formation were deposited in the early Permian. An unstable alluvial-proluvial fan to a stable shallow marine environment has been proposed. In the NE Sonid Youqi area, late Carboniferous to middle Permian carbonate-clastic rocks were deposited in a relatively stable shallow sea with a series of transgressions. Upper continental crust-like geochemical features, magmatic zircons and petrography show that the clastic rocks have a felsic source ranging from granites to tonalite-trondhjemite- granodiorite. Detrital zircons with prominent age groupings at c. 280-330 Ma, c. 350-370 Ma and/or c. 400-500 Ma with some Precambrian ages, together with zircon Hf isotopic data, indicate that the sediments were dominantly sourced from the orogenic belt itself and microcontinents. Basin analysis shows a transition from restricted basins in the late Carboniferous-early Permian to wider and deeper basins in the middle Permian. Accordingly, an extensional stage has been proposed, at least before the final closure of the Solonker Zone.},

   abstract = {The early to mid-Paleozoic subduction-induced terrane accretion along the northern margin of the North China Craton is not well understood. To address this issue, we investigate the magmatic and sedimentary records, including both new and previously published geochemical, Sr-Nd isotopic, and zircon U-Pb-Hf isotopic data from the Bainaimiao Arc. The collected gabbro-diorites and granitoids have been dated to 431-453 Ma. The gabbro-diorites have high Mg/(Mg + Fe) molar ratios (44.41-73.39); depleted Nb, Ta and Ti; and negative epsilon(Nd)(t) values (-9.43--6.80). They were derived from a mantle wedge metasomatized by subduction-derived fluids with crustal contamination. The granitoids are characterized by high silica, low to high K, low Fe and Mg contents, strong fractionation of rare earth elements, and positive epsilon(Hf)(t) values (+1.42-+8.19). They were derived from crustal melts with juvenile additions. The clastic rocks from the Baoerhantu Group and Xibiehe Formation are dominated by early Paleozoic zircons, whereas those from the Bainaimiao Group are dominated by early Paleozoic and Precambrian zircons. Detrital zircon geochronology and field geology confirm their deposition in early to mid-Paleozoic. The U-Pb ages and petrographic and geochemical analyses indicate that the clastic rocks were deposited in arc-related basins with felsic sources from the Bainaimiao Arc. The xenocrystic and detrital zircons in the magmatic and clastic rocks, respectively, imply a Precambrian basement for the Bainaimiao Arc. The early Paleozoic magmatic rocks of the Bainaimiao Arc show secular changes with decreasing age: increasing K2O contents and Sr/Y ratios and decreasing Fe2O3T + MgO contents and epsilon(Hf)(t) and epsilon(Nd)(t) values. This is likely in response to advancing subduction and related crustal thickening. Accordingly, the following tectono-paleogeographic model was proposed for the Bainaimiao Arc: (a) similar to 500-455 Ma initial subduction and juvenile arc development, (b) similar to 455-415 Ma continuous subduction with mature arc development, and (c) similar to 415-400 Ma accretion to the North China Craton.

   abstract = {The exceptionally thick Middle Permian Zhesi Formation is considered key to understanding the late Palaeozoic tectonic setting of the North China-Mongolia segment of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt, yet its sedimentary environment and provenance remain ambiguous. An integrated approach incorporating detailed field observation and measurement, framework petrography, whole-rock geochemistry and detrital zircon U-Pb geochronology is applied here to investigate this problem. The framework petrography and whole-rock geochemical characteristics jointly suggest that the Zhesi Formation was derived primarily from felsic upper continental crust, with the source rocks undergoing intermediate weathering and short-distance transportation. Furthermore, the source rocks were composed of granites/granitoids that occurred in a transitional recycled orogen. LA-ICP-MS U-Pb detrital zircon data from sandstone samples show two main age groups of 480-410 and 290-265Ma. Accordingly, we deduce that the dominant provenance of the Zhesi Formation was northerly early to mid-Palaeozoic orogenic belt, late Palaeozoic granites/granitoids and volcanics, with a possible contribution from the Hunshandake Block. The subsiding depositional environment of this succession is in response to the Middle Permian extensional tectonic setting of the orogenic belt. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

   abstract = {The Tarbagatay Complex, located in northwest Junggar, is situated tectonically between the Zharma-Saur arc to the north and the Tacheng terrane and the Boshchekol-Chingiz arc to the south. This Complex belt is variably composed of ophiolitic melange, sedimentary melange, and coherent units of turbidites and shallow water sediments. These rocks crop out in fault-bound slices with fault-parallel asymmetric folds. Both the lithologies and deformation features of the Tarbagatay Complex suggest an accretionary origin generally with a top-to-the-south tectonic vergence, suggesting N-dipping subduction beneath the Zharma-Saur arc. The presence of a former ocean is indicated by the Ordovician ophiolite melanges and related marine fossils. The time duration of the Tarbagatay Complex can be bracketed by detrital zircon ages of turbidites and shallow water sediments with a lower limit of major peak ages of 350-370Ma, and an upper limit of middle Permian indicated by detrital zircon ages of 262.3Ma. Based on these data, we suggest that the subduction of the Tarbagatay Ocean likely started in the Late Devonian and lasted until the middle Permian. Taking into account the formation of the northern part of the Kazakhstan orocline, which has a similar temporal-spatial framework, we propose a tectonic model for the western CAOB that involves accretion and amalgamation from the Ordovician to the middle Permian.},

   abstract = {Early Palaeozoic evolution of the Kazakhstan orocline in the Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB) is key to reconstructing the Palaeozoic tectonic framework in Central Asia. This study presents field mapping, geochemistry, and geochronological data from the Wulasitai area of northern West Junggar to constrain the subduction polarity and major tectonic events in the Chingiz arc of the Kazakhstan orocline during the Early Palaeozoic. The mapping area outcrops imbricated coherent turbidite slices and melanges that consist of chert, limestone, silt, sandstone, and conglomerate blocks in mudstone matrix, representing an OPS (Ocean Plate Stratigraphy) melange in an accretionary complex. Existing fossil ages from these blocks range from the Ordovician to Silurian, while our new detrital zircon U-Pb samples from the turbiditic matrix yield maximum depositional ages (MDTs) from 428 +/- 2 Ma to 450 +/- 1 Ma. Detrital zircon ages of similar to 510 to 430 Ma in the melange suggest the Chingiz arc to the south of the study area as a major sediment source, providing an indirect constraint on the polarity of subduction. We suggest that the northern part of the Chingiz arc may be underlain by southward subduction, with the accretionary complex located on the Wulasitai area of the northern West Junggar. The Wulasitai melange is overlain depostionally by volcanic rocks carrying depleted HFSE and enriched LILE, LREE. The andesite and tuff are dated to 415 +/- 5 Ma, 414 +/- 3 Ma, and 402 +/- 6 Ma, which we interpret as reflecting the development of the volcanic arc onto the previous subduction complex. This model implies the generation of the arc (accretion arc) as the slab rolling back and trench retreating, which may play an important role in the evolutionary history of CAOB.},

   abstract = {The Kangurtag belt in the Eastern Tianshan, connecting the Dananhu Arc with the Central Tianshan Arc, contains diagnostic rocks of accretionary origin, and thus provides key information about the evolution of the North Tianshan Ocean. The Southern Kangurtag belt is composed of two types of melange. Type I melange consists of Enriched Mid-Ocean Ridge Basalt-type pillow basalts, draped by biohermal limestones and carbonate-siliceous sediments of a slope facies, and siliceous argillites from a hemipelagic-pelagic environment that together make up a seamount assemblage. In Type II melange, Normal Mid-Ocean Ridge Basalt and ribbon cherts were dismembered and entrained in a clastic matrix, showing a "block-in-matrix" structure. Detrital zircons of four sandstones from Devonian and Carboniferous strata within the melanges have a predominant age population of 410-430 Ma and a distinct Proterozoic cluster around 1.4-1.6 Ga. The epsilon Hf(t) values of Phanerozoic zircons range from -25.1 to +8.6. Such age patterns, typical of the Central Tianshan Arc, and the Hf isotopic data indicate that these sedimentary successions were deposited on the northern margin of the Central Tianshan Arc. The youngest detrital zircon age of 317 Ma provides an upper limit for the time of formation of the Southern Kangurtag accretionary complex. Therefore, we suggest that the Southern Kangurtag belt comprises an accretionary complex that developed during southward subduction of the North Tianshan Ocean beneath the Central Tianshan Arc. This subduction began in the Early Ordovician and may have lasted until the Late Carboniferous-Permian.},

   abstract = {Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB) is one of the largest accretionary orogenic belts in the world. The eastern segment of CAOB is dominated by Paleozoic Paleo Asian Ocean tectonic regime, Mesozoic Paleo-Pacific tectonic regime and Mongolian-Okhotsk tectonic regime. The Songliao and Jiamusi blocks are located in the easternmost part of the CAOB and are the key region to solve the problem about overprinting processes of multiple tectonic regimes. It is generally believed that the Mudanjiang Ocean between the two blocks was finally closed in the Mesozoic, but the Paleozoic magmatism also developed along the Mudanjiang suture zone, while on both sides of the suture zone, there were comparable Paleozoic strata, indicating that the two blocks had converged during the Paleozoic, and the evolution history of the two blocks in the Late Paleozoic remains controversial. The Carboniferous-Permian terrestrial strata mainly developed in Binxian, Wuchang and Tieli on Songliao Block, Baoqing and Mishan on Jiamusi Block. Samples from the Songliao and Jiamusi blocks in the Late Carboniferous-Early Permian and Late Permian are collected for comparative analysis. The LA-ICP-MS zircon U-Pb dating results show that the maximum depositional age of Middle Permian Tumenling Formation and Late Permian Hongshan Formation in Songliao Block is similar to 260 Ma, while that of Tatouhe Formation and Carboniferous strata in Jiamusi Block are similar to 290 Ma and similar to 300 Ma, respectively, which supports the previous stratigraphic division scheme. The age peaks of similar to 290-300 Ma, similar to 400 Ma, similar to 500 Ma appeared in the Late Carboniferous to Early Permian strata of Jiamusi Block and the Middle Permian strata of Songliao Block. The age peak of similar to 500 Ma in the Middle Permian strata of Songliao Block may come from the Cambrian basement, Mashan Complex, of Jiamusi Block, while the age peaks of similar to 420-440 Ma in the Carboniferous strata of Jiamusi Block may come from the Silurian magmatic arc in Zhangguangcai Range in the eastern margin of Songliao Block, reflects the history that they had been potential sources of each other, indicating that they may have combined in the Paleozoic. The Hongshan Formation of Songliao Block in the Late Permian lacks the age peak of similar to 500 Ma, which indicate that Jiamusi Block was not the provenance of Songliao Block in the Late Permian, that is, there was a palaeogeographic isolation between the two blocks. Combined with the similar to 210 Ma bimodal volcanic rocks developed along the Mudanjiang suture zone reported previously, we believe that the oceanic basin between the Songliao and Jiamusi blocks should have been connected in Late Permian and reopened during Late Permian to Late Triassic.},

The Junggar-Balkhash Ocean was a major branch of the southern Paleo-Asian Ocean where several arcs were amalgamated. Among them, the Dananhu arc with its characteristic juvenile magmatism and lack of Precambrian basement is an efficient recorder of the evolutional history. From our U-Pb and Lu-Hf isotopic analyses of Devonian to Triassic sediments in the Dananhu arc and Permian sediments in the Yamansu-Central Tianshan arc, we discovered two major changes in detrital zircon provenance of the Dananhu arc: (a) An increasing input of Precambrian ages from the Mongolia collage at 850, 1,850, and 2,500 Ma, together with Phanerozoic zircons ranging from 420 to 480 Ma with negative epsilon Hf(t) value since ca. 288 Ma; (b) the presence of the Yamansu-Central Tianshan arclike Precambrian age cluster of 1,400-1,600 Ma around 243 Ma. In combination with regional tectonothermal events, these two changes correspond to the formation of the Harlik-Dananhu composite arc in the latest Carboniferous-early Permian followed by its collision with the Yamansu-Central Tianshan arc in the latest Permian-early Triassic, which marks the termination of the eastern Junggar-Balkash Ocean. Analysis of the sedimentary successions within the intraoceanic arcs sheds light on the amalgamation history of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt.},

Results show that detrital zircons recovered from three sandstone samples share similar age-probabilities, including four age groups comprising 2100-1760 Ma (55.8%), 2750-2300 Ma (16.1%), 1200-770 Ma (12.3%), and 512-256 Ma (10.1%). By comparison with potential source areas, we conclude that Permian detrital zircons mainly originated from the southern margin of the North China Block, and probably the North Qinling belt as well, while the northern margin of the Yangtze Block did not supply detrital sediment. This distribution implies the South Qinling belt lay adjacent to the North Qinling belt and the North China Block by the Permian, but was separated from the Yangtze Block by the Mianlue Ocean, and support the Late Triassic collision between the Yangtze and North China Blocks.},

   abstract = {Understanding the source to sink relationship through time between the Eastern Kunlun Range, one of the major mountain belts in the northern Tibetan Plateau, and the actively deforming Qaidam Basin to the north has important implications for unravelling the growth history of the Tibetan Plateau. In this study, U-Pb dating (laser-ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry) of detrital zircons from 22 sandstone samples (Paleocene to Holocene) collected from four sections within the southwestern Qaidam Basin is combined with provenance analysis and new seismic profile interpretation to investigate the mountain building of the Eastern Kunlun Range and its effects on the development of the Qaidam Basin. The U-Pb age distributions of detrital grains from Paleocene strata are characterized by a major component of Paleozoic to late Proterozoic ages. Furthermore, carbonate debris containing foraminifera have been recognized in the Paleocene conglomerate sequences. We thus suggest that the Eastern Kunlun Range was already exhumed prior to the Paleocene. The southward onlaps of Paleocene to Oligocene strata observed on seismic profiles and the appearance of a Mesozoic component in the detrital zircon age spectra of Eocene to Oligocene strata indicate that the Qaidam Basin was widening southward during that early Cenozoic period. Well-developed post-Oligocene growth strata and the increasing proportion of Mesozoic and Paleozoic U-Pb ages in detrital zircon grains from late Neogene strata demonstrate that the relief of the Eastern Kunlun and Altyn Tagh Ranges increased, leading to isolation and narrowing of the Qaidam Basin, from Miocene to the present. The inferred pulsed deformation in the Eastern Kunlun Range highlights the complex growth history of the Tibetan Plateau.},

Sandstone composition results show that a sample from the northern Qilian Shan contains more lithic fragments and plots in the recycled orogen field of the quartz-feldspar-lithics (QFL) diagram, while samples from Yumen Basin are more quartz-rich and plot close to the continental block field of the QFL diagram. This compositional difference corresponds to source variation, consistent with the detrital zircon record. Combined with existing sedimentology and low-temperature thermochronology datasets, we suggest the presence of Cretaceous topographic relief in the Bei Shan and Qilian Shan prior to India-Asia collision. Considering >300 km post-Cretaceous left-lateral offset along the Altyn Tagh Fault (ATE) and the consistently similar detrital zircon ages spectra of the samples from the Cretaceous to late Oligocene strata in the Yumen Basin, we infer the paleogeography in the NE Tibetan plateau has been similar from the late Cretaceous to the late Oligocene with ATF termination in the western Yumen Basin instead of having been linked to strike-slip faults in the Alxa or other regions to the east since its initiation.

   abstract = {The Altyn Tagh fault, located in the northern Tibetan Plateau, is a large left-lateral strike-slip fault heavily responsible for the growth and formation of the plateau during Cenozoic time. Despite its significance, the initial timing and kinematic patterns of movement along the Altyn Tagh fault remain highly debated. Here, we present a detailed analysis of the stratigraphy and geochronology of three key lithologic sections (Tula, Anxi, and Caishiling) along the Altyn Tagh fault to better understand this kinematic history. By correlating stratigraphic contacts and lithology with the U-Pb age spectra of Mesozoic samples within the western Qaidam Basin, we find the Altyn Tagh fault has experienced a total of similar to 360 km of displacement during the Cenozoic. By combining seismic profile data with geologic observations, we divide the activity along this fault into two distinct stages of motion: (1) an initial stage, which occurred between early Eocene (ca. 49 Ma) and mid-Miocene time (ca. 15 Ma) and resulted in similar to 170 km of offset, and (2) an early stage, which began in the late Miocene Epoch and continues into the present, resulting in similar to 190 km of offset along the fault. We identify the Tula and Anxi sections as piercing points along the western segment of the Altyn Tagh fault and define these regions as residual parts of the original Qaidam Basin. These estimates suggest that motion along the Altyn Tagh fault has accelerated from an average left-lateral strike-slip rate of similar to 5.0 mm/yr during initial stage faulting to a rate of similar to 12.6 mm/yr between the late Miocene Epoch and present day.},

   abstract = {The Bose Basin in southern China is within a region influenced by the winter westerly monsoon and, thus, potentially subject to eolian dust accumulation. A red earth sequence developed on terraces of the Youjiang River (a branch of the Pearl River) records information about climate variation during the Pleistocene and its relationship to contemporaneous global climate changes. In this study, geochemical characteristics and U-Pb geochronology of detrital zircons of the red earth sequence at Xiaomei were investigated using X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), thermal ionization mass spectrometry (TIMS), and detrital zircon U-Pb dating analyses. Our results show that the red earth sediments are composed of quartz and clay minerals (kaolinite, illite, and mixed -layer illite/vermiculite) with minor hematite and goethite. Mobile elements such as CaO, MgO, Na2O, K2O, Sr and Ba are depleted and immobile elements such as TiO2, Al2O3, Fe2O3(t) and Zr are enriched in comparison with loess-paleosols of the Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP), the upper continental crust (UCC), and post-Archean Australian shale (PAAS). These data indicate that the Xiaomei red earth sediments have experienced intense chemical weathering, similar to that of the Xuancheng and Jiujiang red earth sections on the middle to lower reaches of the Yangtze River. The Xiaomei sediments have similar La/Th ratios, U/Pb vs. Th/Pb relationships, and rare earth element (REE) distributions to the CLP, UCC, and PAAS, and their low epsilon(Nd)(0) values are indicative of an upper crustal origin. The Sm-147/Nd-144 and Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios of the Xiaomei sediments are different from loess-paleosols of the CLP but similar to those of well-mixed river sediments. U-Pb dating of detrital zircons in the Xiaomei sediments shows that crystals from different units have slightly different age distributions. The full Xiaomei section yields a distribution similar to that of Upper Permian-Triassic clastic rocks in the Youjiang area, and the distribution of the middle to upper Xiaomei section additionally shows similarities to upper crust of the South China Craton. Our results indicate that the Xiaomei red earth sequence, which dates to the late Early to early Middle Pleistocene (similar to 1.0-0.6 Ma), accumulated predominantly from fluvially transported, locally weathered materials and, therefore, that the sediment-carrying capacity of the East Asian winter monsoon has been overestimated in previous provenance studies of red earth sediments in South China.},

   abstract = {The pre-Cenozoic structural pattern of Asia has had a strong impact on the localization and propagation of the Cenozoic deformation that gave birth to the Tibetan Plateau. Northern Tibet represents a key area to decipher the structural and kinematic links between the Mesozoic and Cenozoic evolution of Tibet. Nonetheless, the Mesozoic tectonic setting of the North Tibet and the role that the Paleozoic inherited Altyn Tagh Fault (ATF) shearing zone played in controlling the regional tectonic pattern during the deposition of the Mesozoic strata remain controversial. This study is based on seismic reflections, isopach maps of the Mesozoic strata in the Qaidam Basin, and provenance analysis using detrital zircon geochronological and heavy mineral contents. Seismic reflections and isopach maps demonstrate that sustained strike-slip motion along the ATF during the Early to Late Jurassic induced transtensional basin formation. Further away from the main ATF (eastern parts of the Qilian Shan and the northern Qaidam Basin), transtension also occurred along major faults, although local transpression developed in relay zones. Rotation in the regional stress field induced compression and basin inversion during the Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous. The Cenozoic sedimentary rocks in these regions display widespread growth strata and angular unconformities characteristic of compression. This is consistent with topographic changes marked by sediment source variation evidenced by detrital zircon geochronology and heavy mineral analysis. We propose that the mechanism driving the Jurassic extension/transtension in North Tibet could be related to far-field effects of subduction processes along the southern margins of the continent.},

   abstract = {Marking the northern boundary of the Tibetan plateau, the Altyn Tagh fault plays a crucial role in accommodating the Cenozoic crustal deformation affecting the plateau. However, its initiation time and amount of offset are still controversial despite being key information for the understanding of Tibet evolution. In this study, we present 1122 single LA-ICP-MS detrital zircon U-Pb ages obtained from 11 Mesozoic to Cenozoic sandstone samples, collected along two sections in the northwestern Qaidam basin (Eboliang and Huatugou). These data are combined with new 3D seismic reflection profiles to demonstrate that: (1) from the Paleocene to early Eocene, the Eboliang section was approximately located near the present position of Anxi, 360 +/- 40 km southwest from its current location along the Altyn Tagh fault, and sediments were mainly derived from the Altyn Tagh Range. At the same period, the Huatugou section was approximately located near the present position of Tula, ca. 360 km southwest from its current location along the Altyn Tagh fault, and the Eastern Kunlun Range represented a significant sediment source. (2) Left-lateral strike-slip movement along the Altyn Tagh fault initiated during the early-middle Eocene, resulting in northeastward displacement of the two sections. (3) By early Miocene, the intensive deformation within the Altyn Tagh Range and northwestern Qaidam basin strongly modified the drainage system, preventing the materials derived from the Altyn Tagh Range to reach the Eboliang and the Huatugou sections. The post-Oligocene clastic material in the western Qaidam basin is generally derived from local sources and recycling of the deformed Paleocene to Oligocene strata. From these data, we suggest enhanced tectonic activity within the Altyn Tagh Range and northwestern Qaidam basin since Miocene time, and propose an early middle Eocene initiation of left-lateral strike-slip faulting leading to a 360 +/- 40 km offset along the Altyn Tagh fault.

   abstract = {We report in situ U-Pb ages and Hf isotopic compositions of detrital zircons in three metasedimentary gneisses from the Andong area, northeastern Yeongnam Massif, Korea. Zircons from two xenoliths entrained in ca. 250 Ma tonalitic-granodioritic metagranitoids respectively show predominant Silurian clusters slightly overlapping each other within uncertainties (428 +/- 7 and 419 +/- 10 Ma), together with subordinate Archean-Proterozoic peaks. A younger Devonian population (372 +/- 5 Ma) is yielded by the youngest and most dominant age component in a biotite gneiss of the gneiss-marbleamphibolite complex occurring to the southeast of the metagranitoids. The magmatic origin of these zircons is corroborated by their oscillatory cathodoluminescence zoning and relatively high Th/U ratios (0.6 +/- 0.4). Therefore, the depositional timing of the protolith of the gneisses is constrained to be Late Paleozoic. Scattered metamorphic rim dates of the detrital zircons (ca. 260-220 Ma) reflect post-depositional thermal overprints resulting from recurrent arc-related magmatism. Highly variable initial epsilon Hf values of the Silurian zircons (+6 to -18) indicate contributions from both primitive melts and pre-existing crustal materials, which are typical for continental arc magmas. The Silurian-Devonian magmatism recorded in the detrital zircons is possibly linked with the Pb loss event(s) inferred from the zircon data of the Paleoproterozoic basement rocks of northeastern Yeongnam Massif and the overlying Cambrian sediments.},

   abstract = {The paragneiss and migmatitic gneiss on Oki-Dogo Island, located in northern part of southwest Japan, have U-Pb ages ranging from Mesoarchean to Paleoproterozoic. The youngest population of detrital zircons from the paragneiss and migmatitic gneiss suggests a maximum depositional age of ca. 1.96 Ga. Further, the three granitic gneiss samples give zircon U-Pb ages of 1.97, 1.88, and 1.81 Ga. The bulk rock composition of the granitic gneiss samples followed a calc-alkaline trend and showed negative Nb, Ta, P, and Ti anomalies with low Sr/Y (<35), Nb/Th (<1), and Nb/Zr (<0.1) ratios, indicating that the protolith of the granitic gneiss formed in an arc-related setting. Zircons from the granitic rocks in Oki-Dogo Island have negative epsilon(Hf)(t) values with Mesoarchean to Neoarchean model ages (TDM2). The results of geochronological and geochemical analyses and those of previous studies indicate that Oki-Dogo Island underwent two arc-related magmatic events at ca. 1.97 Ga and ca. 1.88-1.81 Ga, which correspond well with those of the Yeongnam massif in South Korea. Thus, we suggest that northern part of southwest Japan (Oki-Dogo Island) was more closely related with the Yeongnam massif than with the North China Craton during the early Paleoproterozoic period.

   abstract = {The early Paleozoic paleogeography of East Gondwanan terranes, including the North China Craton (NCC), is contentious, primarily reflecting the paucity of integrated geochronological, biogeographic, and tectonic data sets. Our new sensitive high-resolution ion microprobe data from 14 sandstones of the Taebaeksan Basin, Korea, indicate that its platform shelf sequences, typified by trilobite faunal assemblages diagnostic of the NCC, record the vestige of coeval arc magmatism. Detrital zircons analyzed from the sandstones yielded Eoarchean to Early Ordovician ages, which define three distinct types of distribution patterns characterized by: (1) double peaks at ca. 1.85 Ga and 2.50 Ga diagnostic of basement rocks in the NCC; (2) minor peaks at ca. 1.75, 1.6, and 1.2-1.1 Ga in addition to double peaks; and finally (3) a scattered array of late Paleoproterozoic to Neoproterozoic zircons lacking double peaks. The marked contrasts among the three types reflect significant changes in provenance, most likely linked to variations in paleowater depths during the "Sauk" transgression. Longshore- or onshore-directed currents, associated with an increase in water depth, apparently brought outboard oceanic detritus and benthic trilobites into the relatively flat outer shelf of the Taebaeksan Basin. As a result, fine-grained sandstones received a large amount of detritus from distal sources, yielding mixed signatures in zircon age patterns and trilobite assemblages. Excluding the basal sandstone-conglomerate unit, five siliciclastic formations contain syndepositional zircon populations, and their weighted mean Pb-206/U-238 ages decrease upsection from 512 +/- 5 Ma to 483 +/- 2 Ma, indicating a sedimentary influx from contemporaneous volcanic activity. In conjunction with arc-related bulk-rock geochemistry and juvenile Nd isotopic signature, early Paleozoic detrital zircons likely represent the first-cycle detritus supplied for similar to 30 m.y. from the proto-Japan arc that initially formed at ca. 520 Ma. Together with the occurrence of ca. 700-500 Ma detrital Pacific Gondwana zircons in fine-grained sandstones, Paleozoic arc-sourced detritus suggests that the Korean Peninsula was paleogeographically linked to an ancient convergent margin, perhaps extending from the Terra Australis orogen.},

SHRIMP U-Pb ages of the newly analyzed zircons range from Archean to Early Paleozoic, and their age patterns permit the definition of four lithotectonic slices: upper and lower Pibanryeong units consisting primarily of quartzite and metasandstone; an upper Poeun unit of black slate containing Early Permian plant fossils; and a lower Poeun unit made up of metasandstone and metadiamictite. A quartzite of the upper Pibanryeong unit yielded two major zircon age populations at 965 +/- 11 Ma and 447 +/- 5 Ma, whereas two lower Pibanryeong metasandstones show major age concentrations at similar to 2.5 Ga, 1.0-0.9 Ga, and 545-535 Ma. The youngest components of these units suggest maximum ages of sedimentation as Late Ordovician and Early Cambrian, respectively. These upper and lower Pibanryeong zircon age distribution patterns are consistent with those of Ordovician and Devonian sedimentary strata, respectively from the South China Craton (SCC). On the other hand, three samples of the lower Poeun unit yielded two distinct age populations at similar to 1.87 Ga and 755 +/- 7 Ma. In addition, a metadiamictite contains abundant Mesoproterozoic zircons with two broad peaks centered at similar to 1.3 and 1.6 Ga. Protolith ages and distribution patterns are profoundly different between the Pibanryeong and Poeun lithotectonic packages, suggesting the presence of a major thrust fault juxtaposing allochthons that are also characterized by large P-T contrasts. Our detrital zircon results for the Pibanryeong unit are compatible with derivation from the SCC, in apparent contrast with the Poeun occurrence of Early Permian plant fossils most likely correlative with the North China Craton (NCC). Taken together, the suturing of Paleozoic metasedimentary terranes in the OMB is a product of Permo-Triassic orogeny reflecting collision of the North and South China cratons. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This formation mainly comprises the sandstone-mudstone units which experienced regional metamorphism at the transitional greenschist-amphibolite facies condition. The majority of detrital zircons yielded concordant ages defining four major age components: (1) Late Archean Early Proterozoic (2.5-2.4 Ga); (2) Middle to Earliest Late Proterozoic (1.0-0.9 Ga); (3) Middle Late Proterozoic (820-750 Ma); and (4) Silurian (similar to 430 Ma). The youngest group gives a weighted mean Pb-206/U-238 age of 431.3 +/- 4.1 Ma (n = 17), confirming the Upper Paleozoic deposition of the Taean Formation. Together with this Silurian peak, the presence of Middle to Late Proterozoic ages is characteristic for the source rock, suggesting that the western Gyeonggi massif could be correlative with the South China craton. On the other hand, the lack of Paleoproterozoic age of similar to 1.87 Ga is in marked contrast with its predominance in the basement rocks of central to eastern Gyeonggi massif. The overall distribution pattern of detrital zircon ages is consistent with that of the Devonian metasedimentary rock in the Imjingang belt, suggesting an extension of this collisional belt towards the south.},

   abstract = {U-Pb ages of detrital zircon grains collected from sandy sediments in the southeastern Yellow Sea were analyzed to infer their provenance. The zircon age spectra show E-W direction differences with a wide age range from Early Cenozoic to Late Archean; the western samples were dominated by Paleozoic to Neoproterozoic zircons, whereas the eastern samples by Paleoproterozoic zircons. This age distribution suggests diversity of age populations in the source terranes and changes in sediment supply to the sample locations. Comparison of these results with the basement rock geology and detrital zircon ages of river sediments in the surrounding land areas indicates that the eastern and western parts of the southeastern Yellow Sea sandy sediments were mainly supplied from the Korean Peninsula and southern China along with now-submerged shelf bedrocks, respectively, with a mixing zone in the middle. Differences in zircon age populations resulted from the change of proportions in sediment supply from two dominant provenances due to sea-level rising and associated reworking during the Holocene transgression.

   abstract = {The detrital zircon geochronological record of Permian-Triassic clastic rocks of the Beishan region in the southern Central Asian orogenic belt indicates a pattern of cyclical, successive Paleozoic accretion events. Comparison of zircon age spectra derived from two individual arc terranes reveals similar age patterns offset by 30-40 m.y. Detrital samples with a provenance interpreted as the southern arc terrane indicate magmatic peaks at 275, 370, and 430 Ma with a 50 m.y. hiatus from 350 to 300 Ma. Samples with a provenance interpreted as the northern arc terrane exhibit a similar pattern yet with consistently earlier component peaks at 310, 400, and 445 Ma with a 40 m.y. hiatus from 380 to 340 Ma. This is interpreted to reflect that subduction developed successively between terranes and progressed until Silurian-Devonian sequential docking of the arcs along separate suture zones. Detrital geochronology of accreted sediments (single peak at 445 Ma) within the northern suture, with coincident tuff and pillow basalt U-Pb zircon ages of 409 +/- 2.9 and 416.6 +/- 15.0 Ma, respectively, may redefine a principal phase of amalgamation as Devonian, over previously interpreted ages in the Carboniferous-Permian. Initiation and cessation of arc magmatism are shown to correlate with regional phases of ophiolite generation and emplacement, respectively. This supports regional models that ophiolite belts in the Central Asian orogenic belt correlate with suture zones developed from multiple contemporaneous subduction systems between arcs. We explore whether a pericratonic archipelago of crustal slivers around the Tarim craton may have initiated successive arc formation.},

We test this model using U-Pb dated detrital zircon grains preserved in Paleogene sedimentary rocks in northern Vietnam and SW China. We applied a series of statistical tests to compare the U-Pb age spectra of the rocks in order to highlight differences and similarities between them and with potential source bedrocks. Monte Carlo mixing models imply that erosion was dominantly derived from the Indochina and Songpan-Garze Blocks and to a lesser extent the Yangtze Craton. Some of the zircon populations indicate local erosion and sedimentation, but others show close similarity both within northern Vietnam, as well as more widely in the Eocene Jianchuan, Paleocene-Oligocene Simao, and Oligocene-Miocene Yuanjiang basins of China. The presence of younger (<200 Ma) zircons from the Qamdo Block of Tibet is less easily explicable in terms of recycling by erosion of older sedimentary rocks and implies a regional drainage linking SE Tibet and the South China Sea in the Late Eocene-Oligocene. Detrital zircons from offshore in the South China Sea showed initial local erosion, but with a connection to a river stretching to SE Tibet in the Late Oligocene. A change from regional to local sources in the Early Miocene in the Yuanjiang Basin indicates the timing of disruption of the old drainage driven by regional plateau uplift.},

   abstract = {We present here bulk sediment major element chemistry, Nd and Sr isotope ratios, and detrital apatite fission-track (AFT) and U-Pb zircon ages to characterize the provenance of the southwestern Taklimakan Desert (northwest China) and the three major rivers draining this region. We establish the spatial and temporal controls on erosion and sediment transport in the modern Tibetan rain shadow. The Hotan River drains the North Kunlun block and is characterized by zircon populations at 160-230 Ma and 370-520 Ma. The -Yarkand River shares these grains with the Hotan, but also has a very prominent zircon population at 40-160 Ma, which is common in Karakoram basement, indicating heavy sediment flux from these ranges to that drainage. This implies a strong control on erosion by topographic steepness and precipitation mediated through glaciation. Our zircon data confirm earlier studies that indicated that the Taklimakan sand is derived from both the Kunlun and Pamir Mountains. AFT ages are younger in the Hotan River than in the Kashgar River, which drains the Pamir, and in both are younger than in the Transhimalaya and parts of the western edge of the Tibetan Plateau. Exhumation is estimated at similar to 1000 m/m. y. in the North Kunlun and similar to 500 m/m. y. in the eastern Pamir, which have been exhuming more slowly than the western ranges in the recent past.
Holocene aggradation terracing was dated using quartz optically stimulated luminescence methods and is mostly associated with times of fluctuating climate after 4 ka, with phases of valley filling dated at 2.6, 1.4, and 0.4 ka. The heights and volumes of the terraces show that sediment storage in the mountains is not a significant buffer to sediment transport, in contrast to the more monsoonal Indus system directly to the south. South of the Mazatag Ridge a significant eolian deposit accumulated similar to 500 yr ago, but this has been deflated in more recent times.
Comparison of the modern river data with those previously measured from Cenozoic foreland sedimentary rocks shows that no sediment similar to that of the modern Yarkand River is seen in the geologic record, which is inferred to be younger than 11 Ma, and probably much less. Uplift of the North Kunlun had started by ca. 17 Ma, somewhat after that of the Pamir and Songpan Garze of northwestern Tibet, dated to before 24 Ma. Sediment from the Kunlun reached the foreland basin between 14 and 11 Ma. North Kunlun exhuma-tion accelerated before 3.7 Ma, likely linked to faster rock uplift.},

   volume = {534},
   abstract = {Whereas the timing for India-Asia collision remains debated, contrasting collisional models provide testable predictions in terms of sediment source contributions during the accumulation of Paleocene to middle Eocene deposits now exposed in the frontal Himalayan system. Within the Lesser Himalaya and frontal thrust system of northwest India, discontinuous exposures of the Cretaceous Singtali Formation and upper Paleocene-middle Eocene Subathu Formation yield a record of these early collisional stages. To test competing collisional models, we analyze the provenance of these deposits with new detrital zircon U-Pb and Hf isotopic data which can distinguish among Indian plate, Asian plate, Kohistan-Ladahk arc, and various Himalayan sources. Detrital zircon age distributions for the Singtali Formation are dominated by Paleoproterozoic zircons with a distinct Cretaceous age component, whereas age data from the Subathu Formation record (1) a marked increase in the relative abundance of Cambrian-Neoproterozoic grains, (2) a decrease in the proportion of Paleoproterozoic grains, and (3) distinct Permian and Late Cretaceous-Paleocene age components. All Cretaceous grains from the Singtali Formation yielded crustal Hf isotopic signatures, indicating a distinctive pre-collisional source of Cretaceous grains of Indian affinity. Zircon Hf isotopic signatures from <320 Ma grains in the Subathu Formation show a significant lower to middle Eocene increase in source diversity, including juvenile grains most likely originating from the Asian plate and Kohistan-Ladakh arc. This requires inception of India-Asia collision by similar to 44-50 Ma-the depositional age of the uppermost Subathu Formation. This major provenance shift is similar to that observed for pre- and post-collisional Tethyan Himalayan strata in the north, which is suggestive of a single contiguous basin linking the Lesser Himalaya by similar to 44-50 Ma and contests the notion that the Lesser and Tethyan Himalaya were separated by a "Greater India Basin" during the Eocene. When coupled with the well documented Paleocene-early Eocene provenance record of the Tethyan Himalaya, these new data provide support for a collisional model in which Asian detritus reached the northernmost edge of India by similar to 59 Ma with terminal closure of both the Shyok and Indus-Yarlung suture zones by similar to 54 Ma.

   abstract = {The kinematic and exhumational evolution of the Lesser Himalaya (LH) remains a topic of debate. In NW India, the stratigraphically diverse LH is separated into the inner LH (iLH) of late Paleo-Mesoproterozoic rocks and the outer LH (oLH) of Cryogenian to Cambrian rocks. Contradictory models regarding the age and structural affinity of the Tons thrust-a prominent structure bounding the oLH and iLH-are grounded in conflicting positions of the oLH prior to Himalayan orogenesis. This study presents new zircon (U-Th)/He and U-Pb ages from the thrust belt and foreland basin of NW India that refine the kinematic and exhumational evolution of the LH. Combined cooling ages and foreland provenance data support emplacement and unroofing of the oLH via southward in-sequence propagation of the Tons thrust by middle Miocene time. This requires that, before India-Asia collision, the oLH was positioned as the southernmost succession of Neoproterozoic-Cambrian strata along the north Indian margin. This is further supported by detrital zircon U-Pb ages from Cretaceous-Paleogene strata (Singtali Formation) unconformably overlying the oLH, which yield diagnostic Cretaceous detrital zircons correlative with coeval strata in the frontal Himalaya of Nepal. A pulse of rapid exhumation along the Tons thrust front at similar to 16 Ma was followed by east-to-west development of a midcrustal ramp at similar to 12 Ma which facilitated diachronous iLH duplexing. This duplexing shifted the locus of maximum exhumation northward, eroding away Main Central Thrust hanging wall rocks until the iLH breached the surface at similar to 9-11 Ma near Nepal and by similar to 3-7 Ma within the Kullu-Rampur window.},

   abstract = {To ascertain the late Early Paleozoic tectonic attribute of the Xing' an terrane, and the distribution and nature of the "Precambrian" basement in NE China, we studied the geochronology, petrology, and geochemistry of the metamorphic rocks of the Jiageda and Woduhe formations in the central Great Xing' an Range. U-Pb ages of detrital zircons from the Jiageda and Woduhe formations vary from 963 to 374 Ma, and can be divided into three groups (963-679, 570-468, and 457-374 Ma). The youngest detrital zircons of the three samples from the Jiageda Formation yield weighted mean ages of 413 +/- 3, 414 +/- 9, and 416 +/- 1 Ma, respectively, indicating that this formation was formed during the late Silurian-early Devonian. The youngest detrital zircons of the sample from the Woduhe Formation yield a weighted mean age of 429 +/- 4 Ma, indicating that this formation was formed during the middle-late Silurian. The protoliths of the metamorphic rocks from the Jiageda and Woduhe formations are terrigenous clastic rocks, with some mafic-intermediate volcanic rocks, characterized mainly by volcanic-sedimentary formation. Considering the geochemical characteristics of the rocks and the regional tectonic setting, we suggest that both the Woduhe and Jiageda formations were formed in an island-arc active-continental-margin environment, and that the Xing'an terrane was located in an active continental margin related to the subduction of the Paleo-Asian Ocean during the middle Silurian-early Devonian. A comparison between the Jiageda and Woduhe formations with respect to their protoliths, geochemical properties, sedimentary environment, and geochronological characteristics shows that the Jiageda Formation does not constitute Precambrian crystalline basement, but instead consists of metamorphosed and deformed late Silurian-early Devonian sedimentary strata intercalated with volcanic rocks. By combining these results with the regional geology, we conclude that the Precambrian basement in NE China is not extensively distributed, being limited to Precambrian metamorphic rocks in the northern Erguna massif and Xing' an terrane, eastern Songliao terrane, and southern Jiamusi massif, and the protolith ages are younger than Neoproterozoic.

   abstract = {The Huili Group, one of the most representative late Mesoproterozoic strata in the Yangtze Block, bears key information for the tectonic history of the South China Block in the context of the supercontinent cycle. We present an integrated dataset involving field observation, petrology, detrital zircon U-Pb dating, and Hf isotope analyses for the Huili Group. Our new detrital zircon U-Pb ages, in combination with available magmatic age data, confirm that the Huili Group was mainly deposited at ca. 1.1-1.0 Ga. The lower Huili Group is characterized by subrounded to rounded detrital zircon grains with age intervals of 2.80- 2.40 Ga (-21%), 2.34-1.72 Ga (-64%), and 1.68-1.19 Ga (-14%). In contrast, zircon grains from the upper Huili Group have variable morphologies and yield two pronounced age populations of 2.00-1.25 Ga (-50%; subrounded to rounded grains) and 1.2-1.0 Ga (-46%; euhedral to subhedral grains). The majority of zircon grains have eHf(t) values and depleted mantle two-stage (TDM2) model ages comparable to those of magmatic rocks or older sediments in the Yangtze Block. Multiple sources are suggested to have contributed older detrital zircon grains to the lower Huili Group, whereas the upper part received greater proportions of zircon grains with ages close to or equal to the depositional age from proximal magmatic sources. This observation indicates a drastic provenance shift most likely occurred within the Huili Group at -1.04 Ga. Through reappraising our detrital zircon results and available geological datasets, we suggest that the terrigenous clastic and carbonate rocks of the lower-middle Huili Group were deposited on a passive continental margin, but the upper volcano-sedimentary sequences were formed in a back-arc extensional setting. We further propose that the Yangtze Block was spatially separated from (i.e., not yet part of) the Rodinia supercontinent during the sedimentation of the Huili Group, supporting that a global supercontinent did not exist yet in the late Mesoproterozoic.

   abstract = {Detrital zircon U-Pb ages and Lu-Hf isotopes of three metasandstone samples from the recently identified Caiziyuan-Tongan accretionary complex (CTAC) in the southwestern Yangtze Block are presented. The detrital zircons are characterized by high Th/U ratios, oscillatory zoning, and nonabrasive crystal shapes, implying that these metasandstones in the CTAC were dominantly derived from proximal magmatic sources. The detrital zircon age spectrum shows three prominent intervals of 2.8-2.6 Ga, 2.5-2.2 Ga, and 2.1-1.7 Ga with minor dispersions between 3.8 and 2.9 Ga, matching well with those of the exposed magmatic rocks in the Yangtze Block. Two samples show consistent youngest age peaks at similar to 1.72 Ga, but the remaining sample has the youngest age peak at similar to 1.56 Ga, indicative of their differences in depositional ages. The Eoarchean zircons have negative epsilon(Hf)(t) values with Hadean depleted mantle two-stage (T-DM2) model ages, indicating the earliest crustal growth of the Yangtze Block in the Hadean. The Mesoarchean to Neoarchean zircons show both negative and positive epsilon(Hf)(t) values, suggesting a prolonged and complicated crustal reworking and growth process. By contrast, the Paleoproterozoic zircons have dominantly negative epsilon(Hf)(t) values, suggestive of extensive crustal reworking in response to the Nuna supercontinent assembly. Available detrital zircon T-DM2 model ages from the southwestern Yangtze Block produce three prominent peaks at similar to 3.06 Ga, similar to 2.95 Ga, and similar to 2.84 Ga, suggesting significant crustal growth pulses in the Mesoarchean. Given that the similar to 1.38 Ga Caiziyuan SSZ-type ophiolitic melange and the complex tectonothermal evolution process, we deduce that the CTAC belt may represent a relict suture zone between micro-blocks in the Yangtze Block and may have witnessed the Nuna breakup and subsequent Rodinia assembly.},

   abstract = {Neoproterozoic sedimentary units at the southeastern margin of the Yangtze Block, South China, record a complex geological history including development of the Jiangnan Orogen during assembly of the Yangtze and Cathaysia blocks and later episodes of glacial activity. The timing of these events is controversial, and we have used U-Pb-Hf compositions of detrital zircons from the Lantian type section to constrain their ages in southern Anhui Province, at the eastern end of the Jiangnan Orogen. This section comprises the Xikou Group below an angular unconformity, and the Xiuning Formation and overlying glacial Leigongwu Formation above the unconformity. Detrital zircons in all three units are dominated by 2.6-2.4 Ga, 2.1-1.9 Ga and 960-740 Ma age populations suggesting erosion from similar source regions, and an increasing proportion of older grains up through the sequence reflects a change in depositional environment from syn-collisional to extensional. Pre-Neoproterozoic zircon grains were derived from the Yangtze Block basement, much of which is now concealed by younger rocks, while the Neoproterozoic population was eroded from local igneous rocks in the Jiangnan Orogen. Zircon Hf isotope compositions indicate that 2.6-2.4 Ga source rocks were a mix of juvenile and reworked crust, while 2.1-1.9 Ga source rocks were dominated by reworked crust. Neoproterozoic sources show a switch from 960-860 Ma juvenile crust to 860-740 Ma juvenile and reworked crust, reflecting a transition in the Jiangnan Orogen from subduction to collision and extension. The youngest detrital grains in the Xikou Group and overlying Xiuning Formation indicate deposition after ca. 810 Ma and ca. 732 Ma, respectively, correlating closely with comparable sequences elsewhere in the Yangtze Block. This demonstrates that the unconformity in South Anhui is part of a regional erosion surface that formed more or less synchronously throughout the orogen at 830-800 Ma, consistent with it dating the end of collision between the Yangtze and Cathaysia blocks. The age of the overlying glacial Leigongwu Formation is difficult to constrain from detrital zircons because of a paucity of post-720 Ma source rocks, but our data suggest the Leigongwu diamictite in the Lantian section is a single Marinoan-age glacial unit deposited after 649 13 Ma. It follows that a carbonate layer in the middle of the Leigongwu diamictite in the Lantian section most likely reflects later faulting, rather than two separate glacial sequences, although we cannot rule out the presence of both Sturtian and Marinoan diamictite elsewhere in South Anhui.

The predominant Neoproterozoic detritus is mainly derived from coeval igneous rocks distributed along the western and northwestern margin of the Yangtze Block. However, most of the pre-Neoproterozoic sediments cannot be matched with exposed basement rocks within the Yangtze Block.

A suite of geochemical approaches mainly including rare earth elemental (REE) analysis and detrital zircon U-Pb dating has been systematically applied to the source-to-sink system involving our upper Miocene-Pliocene Central Canyon sediments and surrounding potential source areas. Based on samples tracing the entire course of the Central Canyon, REE distribution patterns indicate that the western channel was generally characterized by positive Eu anomalies in larger proportion, in contrast to the dominance of negative values of its eastern side during late Miocene-Pliocene. Additionally, for the whole canyon and farther regions of Qiongdongnan Basin, the number of samples bearing negative Eu anomalies tended to increase within younger geological strata. On the other hand, U-Pb geochronology results suggest a wide Proterozoic to Mesozoic age range with peak complexity in Yanshanian, Indosinian, Caledonian and Jinningian periods. However in detail, age combination of most western samples displayed older-age signatures than the eastern. To make it more evidently, western boreholes of the Central Canyon are mainly characterized with confined Indosinian and Caledonian clusters which show great comparability with mafic-to-ultramafic source of Kontum Massif of Central Vietnam, while eastern samples largely bear with distinguishable Yanshanian and Indosinian peaks which more resemble with Hainan Island. Based on geochemistry and geochronology analyses, two significant suppliers and sedimentary infilling processes are generated: (1) the Indosinian collision orogenic belt in central-northern Vietnam, Indochina has ever played significant role in Central Canyon sedimentary evolution, (2) Hainan Island once as a typical provenance restricted within eastern Central Canyon, has been enlarging its influence into the whole channel, even into the farther western regions of Qiongdongnan Basin.},

   abstract = {New insights in the Mesozoic geodynamic evolution and related basin-range interactions in the Kyrgyz Tien Shan were obtained based on new sedimentological and detrital zircon U-Pb (LA-ICP-MS) results from Jurassic to Paleogene sedimentary sequences. Studied sedimentary sections are located in the Fergana and Yarkand-Fergana basins to the west of the Talas-Fergana Fault (TFF) and in the Issyk-Kul and Ming-Kush-Kokomeren basins to the east. The ages of the Phanerozoic zircon grains found in 18 Jurassic to Paleogene sandstones can be divided into four groups: Caledonian (470-390 Ma), Hercynian (315-260 Ma), Triassic (250-210 Ma) and Jurassic (190-160 Ma) ages. The differences in sedimentation pattern and zircon U-Pb results suggest that the TFF played an important role in the distribution of the sedimentary deposits in the Mesozoic. During the Early - Middle Jurassic, the TFF was active and the strongest subsidence occurred in the Yarkand-Fergana Basin. The provenance of its sediments can be explained both by local sources close to the TFF and by more distal sources to the (south) west, probably stretching into the present-day Pamir. During the Late Jurassic - Early Cretaceous, renewed compression led to the inversion of the Yarkand-Fergana Basin. Around the Jurassic - Cretaceous transition, large alluvial fans developing in a semi-arid to arid climate traceable around the whole Tien Shan were also deposited in the Fergana Basin. A mafic sill intruded within these alluvial fans provides an emplacement age of 144 8 Ma (apatite U-Pb) indicating (sub)volcanic activity during the Early Cretaceous. During the Late Cretaceous to early Paleogene, the area to the west of the TFF experienced marine incursions related to the proto-Paratethys Sea. The dominance of Caledonian ages in the Upper Cretaceous - lower Paleogene detrital samples indicates a change in provenance whereby the drainage areas became larger towards low-relief land area east of the TFF.

   abstract = {The Himalaya consists of thrust sheets tectonically shingled together since similar to 58 Ma as India collided with and slid beneath Asia. Major Himalayan structures, including the South Tibetan Detachment (STD), Main Central Thrust (MCT), Lesser Himalayan Duplex (LHD), Main Boundary Thrust (MBT), and Main Frontal Thrust (MFT), persist along strike from northwestern India to Arunachal Pradesh near the eastern end of the orogenic belt. Previous work suggests significant basement involvement and a kinematic history unique to the Arunachal Himalaya. We present new geologic and geochronologic data to support a regional structural cross section and kinematic restoration of the Arunachal Himalaya. Large Paleoproterozoic orthogneiss bodies (Bomdila Gneiss) previously interpreted as Indian basement have ages of similar to 1774-1810 Ma, approximately 50 Ma younger than Lesser Himalayan strata into which their granitic protoliths intruded. Bomdila Gneiss is therefore part of the Lesser Himalayan cover sequence, and no evidence exists for basement involvement in the Arunachal Himalaya. Minimum shortening in rocks structurally beneath the STD is similar to 421 km. The MCT was active during the early Miocene; STD extension overlapped MCT shortening and continued until approximately 15-12 Ma; and growth of the LHD began similar to 11 Ma, followed by slip along the MBT (post-7.5 Ma) and MFT (post-1 Ma) systems. Earlier thrusting events involved long-distance transport of strong, low-taper thrust sheets, whereas events after 12-10 Ma stacked smaller, weaker thrust sheets into a steeply tapered orogenic wedge dominated by duplexing. A coeval kinematic transition is observed in other Himalayan regions, suggesting that orogenic wedge behavior was controlled by rock strength and erodibility.},

   abstract = {Siliciclastic sedimentary rocks derived from the southern Lhasa terrane, sitting depositionally upon rocks of the northern Indian passive continental margin, provide an estimate of the age of initial contact between the continental parts of the Indian and Asian plates. We report sedimentological, sedimentary petrological, and geochronological data from Upper Cretaceous-Paleocene strata in the Sangdanlin section, located along the southern flank of the Indus-Yarlung suture zone in southern Tibet. This is probably the most proximal, and therefore the oldest, record of the India-Asia collision. These strata were deposited by high-density turbidity currents (or concentrated density flows) and suspension settling of pelagic biogenic debris in a deep-marine setting. An abrupt change from quartz-arenitic to feldspatholithic sandstone compositions marks the transition from Indian to Asian sediment provenance. The abrupt compositional change is accompanied by changes in U-Pb ages of detrital zircons diagnostic of a sediment provenance reversal, from Indian to Asian sources. The timing of the transition is bracketed between similar to 60Ma and 58.5 +/- 0.6Ma by detrital zircon U-Pb ages and zircon U-Pb ages from a tuffaceous bed in the upper part of the section. In the context of a palinspastically restored regional paleogeographic framework, data from the Sangdanlin section combined with previously published data from the northern Tethyan Himalaya and the frontal Nepalese Lesser Himalaya and Subhimalaya suggest that a flexural wave migrated similar to 1300km southward across what is now the Himalayan thrust belt from Paleocene time to the present.},

   abstract = {The Paleo-Yangtze Basin is hypothesized to have connected the Sichuan, Xichang, and Chuxiong basins during the Late Mesozoic to Early Cenozoic. The Paleo-Yangtze Basin subsequently fragmented later in the Cenozoic, which makes it challenging to decipher its provenance shifts and the exhumation of the surrounding hinterland. Heavy mineral analyses combined with detrital apatite, rutile, and zircon U-Pb dating were employed to elucidate the stratigraphic signatures and exhumation patterns along the eastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau during the Late Cretaceous to Paleogene. Two key horizons have been identified across these basins based on their detrital mineralogy: a garnet-rich horizon within the southern Sichuan Basin, and a garnet-poor horizon in the Xichang and Chuxiong basins. Furthermore, there is a distinct increase in garnet-zircon (GZi) and apatite-tourmaline (ATi) indices in the Upper Cretaceous Gaokan Formation in the Sichuan Basin, indicating increased sediment input from metamorphic and granitic sources as a result of enhanced uplift and exhumation during the Late Cretaceous. A subsequent decrease in these indices in the Sichuan Basin during the Early Paleogene is attributed to the tectonic quiescence of the western Yangtze region during the Early Cenozoic. It should be noted that a contemporaneous decrease in ATi and RZi indices in both the Xichang and Chuxiong basins sections is observed from the Upper Cretaceous to the Paleogene. Detrital apatite, rutile and zircon U-Pb ages from the Sichuan, Xichang and Chuxiong basins share similar characteristics, and the zircon U-Pb data are dominated by age peaks of ca. 2600-2200 Ma, ca. 1900-1700 Ma, ca. 900-600 Ma, ca. 500-380 Ma, and ca. 260-200 Ma. These data indicate a dominant source from the northwestern and northern Yangtze areas and the region around the Kangdian rift, consistent with predominant southeast- and southwest-directed palaeocurrents in these basins. We thus argue that detritus derived from the northwestern and northern Yangtze areas and Kangdian rift region fed the basins located on the western Yangtze Block throughout Late Cretaceous to Early Paleogene times. The Lanping-Simao and Khorat basins on the Indo-China Block were also fed by these sedimentary source regions, indicating a major transcontinental drainage system across the western Yangtze Block.},

   abstract = {The Late Cenozoic evolution of the major river networks draining eastern Tibet has major tectonic implications for the development of the plateau but remains highly contentious. In this study from the southeastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau, we constrain the evolution of the Paleo-lake Xigeda (recorded by the lacustrine Plio-Pleistocene Xigeda Formation) using combined fission-track (FT) dating, U-Pb and trace-element analysis of detrital apatite, along with U-Pb dating of detrital rutile and zircon. Critically, the detrital apatite U-Pb age data from the Xigeda Formation exhibit a major Late Triassic to Jurassic peak that is also seen in the U-Pb rutile and zircon data. When integrated with apatite fission-track (AFT) age peaks at ca. 60-40 Ma and ca. 20-10 Ma and apatite trace-element analyses, these U-Pb ages support provenance from the Songpan-Ganzi and southern Longmenshan terranes to the north. Thus, the Paleo-Xigeda lake was fed by south-flowing paleo-Dadu and paleo-Yalong rivers during Plio-Pleistocene time. Pliocene tectonic activity on the Xianshuihe-Daliangshan-Xiaojiang fault zone likely formed Paleo-lake Xigeda by damming of the Middle Yangtze River; subsequent capture of the Upper Yangtze by the Middle Yangtze after ca. 1.3 Ma likely breached the Paleo-lake Xigeda.},

   abstract = {Silicic volcanic rocks generally constitute a minor, but key product to track the magmatic evolution in mafic rock dominated large igneous provinces (LIPs). However, for their generally late-stage nature of the silicic volcanic rocks they have a poor preservation potential due to extensive post-eruption erosion. We track the eroded volcanic rocks from the similar to 260 Ma Emeishan LIP by analyzing the provenance of the LIP-derived sedimentary rocks. Sandstones from a cored succession of the Late Permian Longtan Formation in the northern Youjiang Basin are rich in volcanic rock fragments, and associated mudstones have low Al2O3/TiO2 ratios. Detrital zircon grains from the Longtan Formation display typical unimodal U-Pb age spectra with a prominent peak at ca. 260 Ma. These detrital zircons show an overall geochemical affinity akin to those crystallized from within-plate/anorogenic magmas. Such petrological and geochemical characteristics are consistent with a dominant source from the Emeishan volcanic rocks. Through the sampled succession, zircon grains of similar to 260 Ma from the lower Longtan Formation generally display lower U/Yb (most < 0.5) and Th/Nb (most < 10) ratios and higher epsilon Hf(t) values (mostly in the range of +3 to +8) than those from the upper part. A similar sequential variation has also been observed in the Shaiwa Formation, which is an offshore time-equivalent unit to the Longtan Formation. These consistent temporal variations through the sedimentary successions in the Youjiang Basin are interpreted to reflect erosional unroofing of the Emeishan LIP during the Late Permian. These results, integrated with previous studies on the rhyolites and trachytes in Emeishan LIP, reveal a fractional crystallization dominated petrogenetic process with diminishing crustal assimilation for the late-stage silicic volcanism.

   abstract = {The Neoproterozoic succession in the Aksu region of northwestern China forms an unconformable boundary with the lower Precambrian Aksu basement group and consists of the Qiaoenbrak, Yuermeinak, Sugetbrak, and Chigebrak Formations. The two lowermost units include distinct glaciogenic diamictites that indicate distinct episodes of glaciation. In this study, we report the LA-ICP-MS U-Pb ages of detrital zircons and geochemical data from the lower Neoproterozoic strata. The age of the detrital zircon constrains the maximum depositional age to between 769 +/- 10 and 727 +/- 8 Ma for the Qiaoenbrak diamictites, which are associated with the Kaigas glaciation that occurred during the early Cryogenian period. The youngest detrital zircon age of 719 +/- 9 Ma corresponds to the maximum depositional age of the Yuermeinak diamictites, which are associated with the Sturtian glaciation. The detrital zircons from the lower Neoproterozoic strata in the Aksu area indicated four peak ages of 2484, 1948, 861, and 647-581 Ma, which are consistent with the major tectonic episodes in the Tarim Block. The peak age of 2484 Ma represents an Archaean basement, which participated in the worldwide continental nuclei growth event from the late Neoarchaean to the early Palaeoproterozoic. The peak age of 1948 Ma may be associated with the assembly of the Columbia supercontinent, and the 861 and 647-581 Ma are likely associated with the break-up of the Rodinia supercontinent. The combination of geological and geochemical characteristics between the Qiaoenbrak Formation and Aksu Group indicates that the Qiaoenbrak Formation may be penecontemporaneous with the Aksu Group in an active continental margin tectonic setting. Following the break-up of the Rodinia supercontinent, the margin of the Aksu evolved into a passive margin and the Yuermeinak and Sugetbrak Formations were deposited.},

Age spectra of the five samples show a major peak at 2500 Ma and a secondary peak at 2000 Ma, suggesting their provenances were mainly from the crystalline basement of the North China Craton and the Trans-North China Orogen. The youngest zircon has an age of 1673 +/- 44 Ma, indicating that the Chuanlinggou Formation was deposited after this age. From sample MC4 to MC5, lithology changed from a clastic rock (fine-grained sandstone) to a carbonate rock (fine-grained dolomite), suggesting that the depositional basin became progressively deeper. The age spectrum of sample MC5 shows a major peak at 2500 Ma and a secondary peak at 2000 Ma. Sample MC4, which is stratigraphically lower than sample MC5, only had one peak at 2500 Ma. We conclude that there was a transgressive event when sediments represented by MC5 was deposited, and seawater carried ca. 2000 Ma clastic materials to the basin where the Chuanlinggou Formation was deposited, leading to the addition of ca. 2000 Ma detritus. Our research indicates that the source area for the sediments became more extensive with time. We conclude that the Chuanlinggou Formation in the Ming Tombs District was deposited in a low-energy mud flat sedimentary environment in the inter-supra tidal zone because it is mainly composed of silty mudstone and fine-grained sandstone with relatively simple sedimentary structures.},

These strata consist of Middle-Upper Triassic submarine fan and deep marine facies rocks that were deposited in the Paleo-Tethys Ocean. Late Triassic-Early Jurassic contractional deformation in the eastern Hoh-Xil-Songpan-Ganzi complex marks the demise of the Paleo-Tethys Ocean basin and the accretion of the Gondwana-derived Qiangtang terrane to Eurasia. We conducted geological mapping, regional stratigraphic analyses, and U-Pb geochronology of detrital zircons (n = 4128) on the Mesozoic sequences exposed in the Hoh-Xil-Songpan-Ganzi complex, Kunlun terrane, and Qiangtang terrane. We identify for the first time marine silciclastic sandstone and shale of Jurassic age in the northwestern Hoh-Xil-Songpan-Ganzi complex that unconformably overlie Upper Triassic turbidites. Zircon age data indicate that the Middle-Upper Triassic marine gravity-flow deposits of the Hoh-Xil-Songpan-Ganzi complex were shed from the North and South China blocks, and Middle-Late Triassic ultrahigh-pressure Qinling-Dabie orogenic belt, as well as the Kunlun and Qiangtang terranes. In addition, the detrital zircon results suggest vast sediment source to sink distances (> 1500 km) for the Middle-Upper Triassic Hoh-Xil-Songpan-Ganzi strata, which is consistent with tectonic models for the Paleo-Tethys Ocean basin that incorporate significant components of horizontal tectonic transport like opening of large back-arc basins in response to oceanic slab rollback.

   abstract = {The Eastern Guangxi area locates in the southwestern part of the transition zone between Yangtze and Cathaysia blocks, which is an important region because the boundary between two blocks probablycrosses there. We determined LA-ICPMS U-Pb ages for detrital zircons extracted from three sandstone samples in the Sinian-Cambrian strata in this region. The resulting ages are in the range of the Archeozoic and Neoproterozoic, with three notable concentrates at 991 Ma, 974 Ma, and 964 Ma, all of which are coeval to the Grenvillian magmatic activity. The new age distribution is similar to the data reported in the Precambrian strata of the adjacent southwestern Cathaysia Block, suggesting that most of our detrital zircons are likely derived from the Cathaysia Block. Combined with others' research, we are more inclined to accept the opinion that there was not an ocean basin between the two blocks during the Sinian-Cambrian period in Eastern Guangxi area if the timing of collision is the Early Neoproterzoic. But if the timing of collision is the Early Paleozoic, we conclude that Luzhai uplift (i.e., the uplift between Guilin-Yongfu faultand Lipu fault) beyond the west of Dayaoshan regoin might be one part of southwestern sedimentation boundary of Cathaysia Block and Yangtze Block. We also get a few of detrital zircons with ages of 590 Ma which probably sourced from northeastern Gondwana and 13 detrital zircons with over 3 000 Ma U-Pb ages which record the early formation of the earth.},

   abstract = {Detrital zircon U-Pb geochronology serves as a proxy to study of crustal evolution and provenance discrimination. In order to unravel episodic tectonothermal events and their tectonic relationship between the North China Craton (NCC) and North Qinling Orogenic Belt (NQOB), detrital zircons from modern river sands and metasedimentary rocks were collected and dated by LA-ICPMS. Although the western NCC (Ordos block) is covered by Paleozoic-Cenozoic basin sediments, the U-Pb dating results show that the age populations of detrital zircons from the western NCC present prominent U-Pb age peaks at 2475 Ma and 1850 Ma, which indicates the western NCC (Ordos block) also has early Precambrian basement similar to the eastern and central craton. In addition, a significant number of early Paleozoic (520-400 Ma) zircons have been found in the western NCC, which is quite different from :he eastern NCC and is considered to be related to the collision between the NQOB and the NCC. The age spectra of detrital zircons from the NQOB presents a complex age pattern, which reveals four major age groups of Neoarchean (2.6-2.4 Ga), Neoproterozoic (1.0-0.85 Ga), early-middle Paleozoic (450-350 Ma) and early Mesozoic (250-170 Ma). As indicated by the U-Pb isotopic data that the NQOB could be an independent terrane at least prior to the Neoproterozoic and once a portion of the Grenville orogenic belt during the 1.2-0.8 Ga with a peak of similar to 1.0 Ga. In other words, the NQOB has its unique geological evolution history obviously different from those of the NCC and the Yangtze Craton. The complete collision between the NQOB and the NCC perhaps took place at Paleozoic (450-400 Ma). (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {The Upper Wulashan "Subgroup" at Daqingshan in the Khondalite Belt of the Western Block of the North China Craton contains an Early Paleoproterozoic (2.5-2.45 Ga) supracrustal sequence, incorporating banded iron formations, which we refer to as the Daqingshan Supracrustal Rocks. They contain rounded to elliptical zircon grains that commonly show core-rim or core-mantle-rim structures and precise SHRIMP U-Pb dating of these domains allows the discrimination of a series of tectono-thermal events that straddle the Archean/Proterozoic boundary. Detrital zircon cores with oscillatory zoning have formation ages ranging from 2.55 to 2.50 Ga, indicating derivation from Late Neoarchean magmatic rocks. As a result of exhumation and erosion, these became incorporated in earliest Paleoproterozoic sediments that were deposited between 2.50 and 2.45 Ga and then underwent high-grade metamorphism at 2.45-2.40 Ga. This event variously recrystallized the cores into two main domains: a dark inner domain and a gray outer domain, as imaged in cathodoluminescence. The gray domains commonly show sector zoning and have Th/U ratios of 0.1-0.5, a feature commonly noted in zircons recrystallized under high-grade metamorphic conditions. Metamorphic mantles are generally more homogeneous in structure and have lower Th/U ratios (commonly <0.1) than the recrystallized domains, although they show similar age distributions. However, they are difficult to distinguish when only two domains are present in the zircon and they represent a continuum of recrystallization.The rocks then underwent a second episode of high-grade metamorphism in the late Paleoproterozoic, as revealed by thin overgrowth rims that are homogeneous or show only weak zoning, have low Th/U ratios (commonly <0.1), and record ages of 1.95-1.90 Ga. This is the first time that two tectono-thermal events of Early and Late Paleoproterozoic age have been identified in single rock samples from the Western Block of the North China Craton. The conclusion that unequivocal earliest Paleoproterozoic sediments are present in the North China Craton is also supported by evidence that the Daqingshan Supracnistal Rocks are cut by anatectic garnet granite, previously dated at 239 Ga. Combined with evidence obtained here and elsewhere in the North China Craton, we conclude that the 2.45-2.40 Ga metamorphism was not an extension of the well-established, craton-wide Late Neoarchean tectono-thermal event, but a previously unrecognized episode that followed a short quiescent period that allowed sedimentation of the Daqingshan Supracrustal Rocks.

   abstract = {The Mangar depression, located in the eastern part of the Tarim basin, had deposited extremely-thick lower Paleozoic sediments, which yields great scientific value and hydrocarbon resource potential. Due to the lack of enough outcrop and core studies, many issues, e.g., early Paleozoic geographical evolution, basin nature and tectonic affinity, are still poorly understood. In this study, we selected circum-Mangar areas (i.e., the South Quruqtagh, Tabei and Tazhong areas), and carried out comprehensive detrital provenance analysis including detrital modal analysis, heavy mineral and trace element analysis, and detrital zircon U-Pb dating on the Middle Upper Ordovician and Silurian sandstones. The results show that Upper Ordovician-Lower Silurian detrital provenances of the South Quruqtagh and Tabei areas were primarily derived from the intracontinental uplifts in Tarim. Meanwhile, Upper Silurian detrital provenances of the above two areas were mainly derived from the mix of intracontinental uplifts and continental-margin arcs. Dramatic Late Silurian provenance-change suggests the evident tectonic transition of the northern Tarim margin, which is the opening of the South Tianshan back-arc oceanic basin. Combining the previous studies, an integral redefinition model for the Mangar depression has been made. The evolution process of the Mangar depression could be divided into four stages: graben stage (late Neoproterozoic), transitional stage (Cambrian to Middle Ordovician), downwarp stage (Late Ordovician to Early Silurian) and extinction stage (Late Silurian). Hence, the Mangar depression evolved as anaulacogen. Significantly, the evolutional scenario of the Mangar aulacogen was consistent with that of the North Altyn Tagh and the North Qilian, suggesting that the Mangar aulacogen was involved mainly in the Proto-Tethys tectonic realm south to the Tarim block. However, the Late Silurian tectonic activity in the northern Tarim margin did produce massive detrital sources for northern part of the Mangar aulacogen and aggravated the extinction process of the Mangar aulacogen.

   abstract = {Figuring out whether the sedimentary provenance regions of the thick deep-water turbidite systems deposited during Middle-Upper Ordovician in South Quruqtagh are the intracontinental uplifts or the peripheral orogenic belts is of great significance for us to understand the tectono-sedimentary nature of the northeastern Tarim Basin and basin-range coupling processes in the middle Paleozoic. This paper reports the in situ LA-ICP-MS U-Pb ages and Hf isotope data on detrital zircons from two Middle-Upper Ordovician sandstone samples which were collected from the Charchag Formation and the Zatupo Formation in South Quruqtagh, respectively. The results show that the studied two samples have extremely similar U-Pb age patterns and Hf isotopic compositions, reflecting multiphase tectono-thermal events with age groups of 527-694, 713-870 Ma (peaking at 760 Ma), 904-1,090, 1,787-2,094 Ma (peaking at 1,975 Ma) and 2,419-2,517 Ma. Combining previous studies, the presence of age groups of 713-1,090 and 1,787-2,094 Ma, respectively, demonstrates that Tarim had ever been a part of Rodinia and Columbia supercontinent. Moreover, 98 % of 713-870 Ma detrital zircons are characterized by negative epsilon (Hf) (t) values ranging from -38.07 to -0.61, which are highly consistent with those of Neoproterozoic granites from the Quruqtagh area. No Early Paleozoic ages (similar to 470-500 Ma) signifying subduction or collision events in Altyn Tagh were detected in the two samples, indicating that the Middle-Late Ordovician sediments in South Quruqtagh and northern Mangar depression were mainly derived from intracontinental uplifts, i.e., the North Quruqtagh uplift or the Tabei paleo-uplift, rather than the Altyn Tagh. In conjunction with regional sedimentary-tectonic background and previous studies, we proposed preliminarily that the northeastern Tarim remained as a passive continental margin in Late Ordovician and changed into an active-continental margin in Silurian due to the southward subduction of the South-Tianshan Ocean.},

   abstract = {The tectonic relationship between the Alxa Block and the North China Craton has long been controversial. The Helanshan area lies at the western margin of the Ordos Block and to the east of the Alxa Block, and it contains Eidacaran Zhengmuguan Formation and Tuerkeng Formation. The Zhengmuguan Formation is made up of tillites, limestone and dolomine, and the Tuerkeng Formation consists of silty slate. A parallel unconformity marks the boundary between the Tuerkeng Formation and the Early Cambrian Suyukou Formation, which is composed mainly of phosphatic pebbly sandstone and sandstone. U-Pb dating ages of detrital zircons in the Zhengmuguan and Suyukou Formations reveal two Neoproterozoic age peaks of 818 4 Ma (n = 88) and 905 8 Ma (n = 20). Neoproterozoic magmatic events have yet been reported in the basement of the Ordos Block, while some Neoproterozoic igneous rocks have been found in the basement of the Alxa Block. Moreover, the two Neoproterozoic age peaks correspond well with the ages of Neoproterozoic igneous rocks in Alxa Block. The Hf isotopic characteristics of a part of Neoproterozoic zircons from the Ediacaran Zhengmuguan Formation in the Helanshan area (epsilon(Hf)(t) = -7.812 to 3.274, T-DMC = 2211-1578 Ma, n =10) are similar to those Neoproterozoic igneous zircons from the Langshan area (epsilon(Hf)(t) = -1.105 to 5.928, T-DMC = 1.75-1.38 Ga, n = 23) and Bayinnuoergong area in the Alxa Block. The parental magmas had a long residency time in the crust. It seems, therefore, that Alxa Block provenance provided Neoproterozoic clastics for Helanshan area in Ediacaran, and Alxa Block had already been a part of the North China Craton by the late Neoproterozoic, even earlier.

   abstract = {The involvement of the North China Craton (NCC) in the assembly or breakup of Rodinia has long been debated. Studies of palaeomagnetism, mafic sills (dikes), igneous events, and sedimentary records have led to contrasting opinions on this topic. No igneous events related to the late Mesoproterozoic assembly of Rodinia have been reported in the NCC. However, the authors found numerous late Mesoproterozoic zircons in the Tonian system on the northern margin of the NCC. The Tonian Zhulazhagamaodao formation is composed of meta-sandstone, siltstone, slate, carbonate, and dolomine of the littoral to neritic facies and occurs mainly in the western part of the Bayan Obo-Zhaertai-Langshan rift. U-Pb dating of detrital zircons from the Tonian system reveals age peaks at 1079 +/- 23 Ma, 1092 +/- 22 Ma, 1175 +/- 50 Ma, 1175 +/- 18 Ma, 1260 +/- 45 Ma, 1266 +/- 16 Ma, and 1270 +/- 26 Ma, which correspond to the timing of Rodinia assembly. Considering that coeval igneous rocks and orogenic belts developed mostly in the Laurentia-Baltica cratons, we propose that these cratons supplied clastic material to the northern margin of the NCC and that they had a close spatial relationship between each other during the Tonian.},

   abstract = {The Heilongjiang Complex, located between the Jiamusi and Songnen-Zhangguangcai Range massifs, has become a focus of tectonic research in recent years. Here we document new U-Pb detrital zircon age data for metasedimentary rocks from the Heilongjiang Complex in Yilan-Huanan counties. These data not only provide important constraints on the depositional timing and provenance, but also give further insights into the complicated convergence history of the Jiamusi and Songnen-Zhangguangcai Range massifs. Most zircons from the Heilongjiang Complex show "magmatic-like" zircon rare earth element patterns, with enrichment in heavy rare earth elements and positive Ce and negative Eu anomalies, suggesting a magmatic origin. Laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry zircon U-Pb analysis indicates that the youngest detrital zircons in these metasedimentary rocks have concordant Pb-206/U-238 ages of ca. 230-130 Ma. Based on this finding and the Middle Jurassic metamorphic ages of the Heilongjiang Complex, we conclude that metasedimentary rocks of the Yilan Heilongjiang Complex were deposited during the Late Triassic-Early Jurassic. Approximately 55% of the detrital zircons yield ages of 297 to 180 Ma, with peaks at 270-245 Ma, 230-200 Ma and 200-180 Ma. while 27% of the detrital zircons yield ages of 544-412 Ma with a peak at 500-480 Ma. Proterozoic detrital zircons (similar to 15%) were also identified, yielding ages of 2352 to 595 Ma, with most being of Neoproterozoic age. These results, combined with field relationships and previously published ages, suggest that detrital zircons in the Yilan Heilongjiang Complex were sourced mainly from igneous rocks in the Jiamusi and Songnen-Zhangguangcai Range massifs. Moreover, the protoliths of the metasedimentary rocks in the Yilan Heilongjiang Complex were most likely deposited in a forearc basin setting during convergence between the Jiamusi and Songnen-Zhangguangcai Range massifs.

The new data and geological evidence show that the FAS was deposited in a fore-arc basin with an exclusive source of the clastics in the North Qinling Belt (NQB). The depositional age of FAS is limited by the youngest U-Pb 455 Ma-ages of detrital zircons from clastics and the intrusive age of 435 +/- 7 Ma of mafic dykes between the Late Ordovician-Early Silurian, while the NCB was still separated from the SCB by the Shangdan Ocean. However, detrital zircon U-Pb ages from six samples of the Middle Devonian Liuling Group indicate sources in both NQB and SCB suggesting pre-Middle Devonian collision of NCB and SCB. All results indicate deposition of the FAS in a forearc setting upon an active continental margin during Late Ordovician-Early Silurian, while the Middle-Upper Devonian Liuling Group represents a marine foreland basin after closure of the Shangdan Ocean. Together with the unconformity between Middle Devonian and pre-Devonian strata, this reveals still evolving subduction and accretion on the southern side of the NQB during the Ordovician-Early Silurian, and the Early Devonian collision between the NCB and SCB.

   abstract = {The Gantaohe Group, located in the Zanhuang area, contains typical North China Craton Paleoproterozoic strata, and is one of the best-preserved examples of these rocks. It is therefore a significant area for deciphering evolutionary process in the trans-North China Orogen. In this paper, we present petrologic, detrital and volcanic zircon U-Pb ages and Lu-Hf isotopes from three formations of the Gantaohe Group. The zircons from a conglomerate at the base of the Gantaohe Group yielded a young population of ca. 2.1 Ga. Dacite from the upper section of the Nansizhang Formation yielded zircon Pb-207/ Pb-206 ages of 2090 +/- 14 Ma. Thus, the initial deposition of the Gantaohe Group occurred at similar to 2.1 Ga. The Group underwent greenschist to low amphibolite facies metamorphism, identical to regional 1.87-1.85 Ga metamorphism in Zanhuang Complex. Therefore, we propose that the Gantaohe Group was deposited in the period between 2.1 Ga and 1.9 Ga. Sandstones in the Gantaohe Group are dominated by Q (monocrystalline and polycrystalline quartz) and F (K-feldspar and plagioclase) with only minor lithic fragments, suggesting that detrital components were mainly derived from a cratonic source. Detrital zircons from sandstones exhibit a dominant population of 2.55-2.5 Ga grains with minor contributions of similar to 2.7 Ga and similar to 2.1 Ga grains, which further indicate they were dominantly sourced from similar to 2.5 Ga TTG gneisses, late Archean Zanhuang and late Archean to Paleoproterozoic Guandu Groups, with subordinately input from similar to 2.7 Ga TTG gneisses and the Paleoproterozoic Xuting granite. Given that the sandstone clastic components chiefly comprise quartz and feldspar, there is a lack of volcanic lithics, and the major detrital zircons are 400 Ma older than the initial deposition age, we propose that the Gantaohe Group was deposited in a rift-related setting far from any back-arc basin at similar to 2.1 Ga or 1880-1810 Ma syn-collisional processes. A few 2.5-2.7 Ga zircons have positive epsilon(Hf)(t) values identical with the contemporaneous depleted mantle and the Pb-207/Pb-206 ages are similar to their single stage model ages (T-DM1), which suggests some degree of 2.5-2.7 Ga crustal growth. Most similar to 2.5 zircons, however, show Pb-207/Pb-206 ages that are much younger than the Hf single stage model ages, which indicates intensive crustal reworking in the late Neoarchean. The zircons collectively present two stage model ages ranging from 2.6 to 2.9 Ga. Therefore, we suggest that the 2.6-2.9 Ga periods represents a time of intensive crustal growth in the Zanhuang Complex. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Zircon U-Pb ages (SHRIMP and LA-ICPMS) and Lu-Hf isotope data (LA-ICPMS) are presented for two granite and two quartzite pebbles from the basal conglomerates of the Sijizhuang Formation in the Hutuo Group from the Wutai Mountains area in the North China Craton. These two granite pebbles give zircon Pb-207/Pb-206 ages of 2513 +/- 8 Ma and 2527 +/- 8 Ma respectively, which are consistent with the emplacement ages of the Wangjiahui grey granite and Guangmingsi or Shifo granite in the Wutai Mountains. Detrital zircons from those two quartzite pebbles are mostly 2550-2490 Ma old with lesser number of 2800-2550 Ma grains, which is similar to the ages of detrital zircons from quartzites in the Gaofan Subgroup of the Neoarchean Wutai Group. Thus, the pebbles in the Hutuo Group basal conglomerates were derived locally from Wutai Mountains Neoarchean sources. Zircons from the Sijizhuang Formation conglomerate granite and quartzite pebbles mostly have positive E > (Hf)(t) values, a minority with E > (Hf)(t) values like model depleted mantle (DM) of the same age, but with most showing DM model ages 200-100 Ma. This indicates that most of the source materials were derived from the mantle within the previous 200 million years, whereas some are derived from 2550-2510 Ma juvenile crustal additions. This additional evidence suggests that in the North China Craton there was important initial polycyclic crustal formation and cratonization in the late Neoarchaean, prior to superimposed Palaeoproterozoic orogenic cycles.},

   abstract = {In the eastern part of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB) in northeastern (NE) China, scattered outcrops of molasse deposits mark the ending of an orogeny and are crucial for understanding the evolution of the Paleo-Asian Ocean (PAO). However, the timing of tectonic events and the relationships among these strata remain controversial. To better constrain these geologic events, a comprehensive study of the detrital zircon U-Pb geochronology and geochemistry of the sandstones of the Kaishantun (KST) Formation and Kedao (KD) Group in eastern Jilin Province, NE China, was conducted. The KST Formation is traditionally considered a molasse deposit. The sandstones display low CIA, PIA and high ICV values and low Th/U and Rb/Sr ratios, which suggest that the rocks were derived from an immature intermediate-felsic igneous source and experienced a simple sedimentary recycling history with relatively weak chemical weathering. LA-ICP-MS U-Pb dating of detrital zircons from two samples of the KST Formation yields ages of 748-252 Ma, suggesting that the KST Formation was deposited between 254.5 Ma and 252 Ma in Late Permian. The zircons were mainly derived from the continental northern part of the North China Craton (NCC). In contrast, the U-Pb dating of detrital zircons from five samples of the KD Group yields ages of 2611-230 Ma, suggesting that the KD samples were deposited in the Early to Middle Triassic (ca. 248-233 Ma). The detrital zircon ages for the KD samples can be divided into groups with peaks at 2.5 Ga, 1.8 Ga, 800-1000 Ma, 500 Ma and 440-360 Ma, which suggest that the samples were derived from bidirectional provenances in the Jiamusi-Khanka Block and the NCC. These new data, combined with previously published results, suggest that at least three orogenic events occurred in central-eastern Jilin Province during the Early Permian (270-262 Ma), Early Triassic (254-248 Ma) and Middle-Late Triassic (242-227 Ma). The final closure of the PAO occurred during 242-227 Ma in the Middle-Late Triassic along the Changchun-Yanji suture zone. The detrital zircon geochronological data clearly record plate convergence and the scissor-like closure of the PAO in the eastern CAOB.

   abstract = {In the Yanbian area, northeastern China, Late Paleozoic sedimentary successions are well developed and contain both Angaran and Cathaysian-derived floras. The flora-bearing successions were originally thought to be Permian in age and these flora fossils disappeared after the Permo-Triassic mass extinction (PTME). The Jiefangcun Formation was thus assigned a Permian age. In this study, the weighted mean 206Pb/238U ages of the youngest zircons from two samples from the Jiefangcun Formation are 246.8 +/- 2 Ma (MSWD = 0.65, n = 11) and 247.2 +/- 3 Ma (MSWD = 0.15, n = 7). One dacite above this formation is dated to 241 +/- 16 Ma (MSWD = 2.6, n = 3). Therefore, the Jiefangcun Formation was deposited during the Middle Triassic (247-241 Ma). This result further suggested that the Angaran and Cathaysian floras did not disappear after the PTME and recovered in the Middle Triassic. Moreover, the chemical index of alteration, index of compositional variability, and plagioclase index of alteration values suggest that the sediments of the Jiefangcun Formation were derived from an intermediate-felsic igneous source with a weak degree of weathering and simple sedimentary recycling history. The Rb/K, Sr/Ba, V/Ni and Sr/Cu values indicate that this formation was deposited in micro-saline water in an arid climate. Detrital zircon ages from the North China Craton and Jiamusi-Mongolia block in this formation suggest that the proximal provenance was bidirectional. The Paleo-Asian Ocean was therefore finally closed during the Middle Triassic with the witness of floral recovery in the Yanbian area.},

   abstract = {The tectonically complex geology of southeast Asia provides a unique window on the mechanics of continental collision, and the ways in which orogens are assembled through a combination of steady-state subduction and the closure of ocean basins. The Triassic turbidite system of the Nanpanjiang basin has long been accepted as a sedimentary archive of the collision between the South China and Indochina blocks. Paleocurrent restoration and the arrangement of deep-water architectural elements together suggest that the turbidite system was filled primarily from east to west, consistent with axial flow in deep water roughly parallel to intrabasinal faults. These observations and new U-Pb ages and Hf isotope data for detrital zircons obtained from Middle Triassic turbidites and approximately correlative Ladinian floodplain deposits suggest that the sediments were not derived from the hypothesized collisional orogen, but for the most part came from a poorly preserved arc associated with the convergent plate boundary of southern China. Hafnium isotopic data for dated euhedral zircons of Paleozoic age more closely match the pattern expected for steady-state subduction of oceanic lithosphere than for continental collision. Our data lead to a new model for the Triassic tectonic evolution of South China and draw attention to the value of dating detrital grains within the sediment delivery system as well as at the final site of turbidite deposition.},

   abstract = {U-Pb detrital zircon geochronology from Lower Devonian quartz arenites of the northwestern margin of the Yangtze block yields dominant early Neoproterozoic (0.85-1.0 Ga), Pan-African (0.5-0.65 Ga) and middle Neoproterozoic (0.68-0.8 Ga) age populations and minor Mesoproterozoic to middle Mesoarchean (1.0-3.0 Ga) ages. Middle Mesoarchean to Mesoproterozoic rocks, however, are widespread in the South China block. Although Hf isotopic compositions show both juvenile crustal growth and crustal reworking for all the age groupings, the crust growth, essentially mantle-derived, occurred mainly around 3.1 Ga, 1.9 Ga and 1.0 Ga, respectively. Zircon typology and youngest grain ages indicate that this suite of quartz arenites was the product of multiphase reworking. Abundant magmatic zircon detritus with concordant U-Pb Grenvillian and Pan-African ages, together with accompanying various epsilon(Hf(t)) values, indicate an exotic provenance for the quartz arenite external to the South China block. Qualitative comparisons of age spectra for the late Neoproterozoic sediments of the Cathaysian Block, early Paleozoic sediments of pre-rift Tethyan Himalaya sequence in North India and lower Paleozoic sandstone from the Perth Basin in West Australia, show that they all have two the largest age clusters representing Grenvillian and Pan-African orogenic episodes. The resemblance of these age spectra and zircon typology suggests that the most likely source for the Lower Devonian quartz arenites of the South China block was the East African Orogen and Kuunga Orogen for their early Grenvillian and Pan-African populations, whereas the Hannan-Panxi arc, Jiangnan orogen, and the Yangtze block basements might have contributed to the detrital zircon grains of the Neoproterozoic and Pre-Grenvillian ages. Hf isotopic data indicate that the crustal evolution of the drainage area matches well with the episodic crust generation of Gondwana. These results imply that the previously suggested position of the SCB in Gondwana should be re-evaluated, and the South China block should be linked with North India and West Australia as a part of East Gondwana during the assembly of Gondwana, rather than a discrete continent block in the paleo-Pacific.

   abstract = {There is a broad consensus that the Solonker Suture Zone marks the final closure of the Paleo-Asian Ocean, which led to the formation of the eastern segment of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt. However, when and how the final closure occurred still remains controversial. To address this issue, provenance analysis of Permian sedimentary rocks of arc basins along the Xar Moron River was carried out. Geochemical analysis revealed a close relationship between the sedimentary and volcanic rock suite in the study region suggesting short transport distances and a complex convergent arc setting. Detrital zircon U-Pb analysis identified two major age provenances: (1) the Precambrian basement of the North China Craton (similar to 2497 Ma and similar to 1844 Ma) and (2) the Paleozoic Southern Accretionary Orogen along the northern margin of North China (similar to 436 Ma and similar to 269 Ma). The present locations of identified age provenances indicate southward subduction beneath the northern margin of North China. A comparison of the youngest age population in the sedimentary rocks with U-Pb ages obtained for subduction-related volcanic rocks implies that the Solonker Suture Zone formed from the Late Permian to Early Triassic. The results of our study advocate a complex Permian arc system which was probably similar to present-day Southeast Asia.},

   abstract = {The Central Asian orogenic belt formed by accretion subsequent to the contraction of the paleo-Asian Ocean, and its southeastern segment terminated along the Solonker suture zone, amalgamating the Mongolian arcs and the North China craton by the end of the Early Triassic. Since typical regional collisional features are absent, its tectonic evolution remains speculative. An investigation into the variability of detrital zircon U-Pb ages and Hf ratios in Permian strata along a southeast-northwest transect from the Mongolian arcs to the North China craton reveals distinct differences: Northern basins carry a broad Mesoproterozoic to latest Precambrian age signature, and their sedimentary source terranes are of mixed juvenile to crustal magmatic origin. In contrast, southern basins contain detritus from the North China craton, and their sources are of dominantly crustal contaminated magmatic origin. Provenance analysis suggests that in the early Paleozoic ca. 429 Ma), the paleo-Asian Ocean was consumed along the Uliastai arc and the North China craton, initiating the formation of the northern and southern accretionary orogens, respectively. By the end of the middle Carboniferous, the Mongolian arcs were consolidated after the accretion of the Uliastai arc. In the late Carboniferous ca. 314 Ma), the Hegenshan back-arc basin opened, detaching the northern accretionary orogen. While subduction continued there, it may have temporarily ceased in the south after the accretion of a microcontinent ca. 300 Ma). By the end of the Middle Permian ca. 269 Ma), back-arc basin closure led to the formation and obduction of the suprasubduction zone Hegenshan ophiolite. Eventually, the paleo-Asian Ocean closed by double-sided subduction. Such accretionary wedge-wedge collision would not involve continental deep subduction, unlike other continental collisions. The early stages of the sequence likely resembled a Pacific-type scenario dominated by the subduction of oceanic lithosphere, including a Japanese Sea-type back-arc basin opening. The late stages involved the accretion of large-scale continental blocks, ultimately leading to final ocean closure, which may be similar to the archipelago-type setting of present-day Southeast Asia.},

Although surrounded by several magmatic and orogenic belts, the Triassic high- and ultrahigh-pressure Qinling-Tongbai-Hong'an-Dabie (QTHD) orogen, located several hundred kilometers to the east, was proposed as its major source. Middle to Late Triassic samples from the northern and southern Songpan-Ganzi complex, studied using detrital white mica Ar-40/(39) Ar ages, Si-in-white mica content, and detrital zircon U/Pb ages, suggest that the northern Songpan-Ganzi deposystem obtained detritus from the north: the north China block, east Kunlun, northern Qaidam, Qilian, and western Qinling; the southern Songpan-Ganzi deposystem was supplied from the northeasterly located Paleozoic QTHD area throughout the Ladinian and received detritus from the Triassic Hong'an-Dabie orogen during the Carnian, indicative of exhumation of the orogen at that time. The QTHD orogen fed the Norian samples in the southeastern southern Songpan-Ganzi deposystem, signifying long drainage channels along the western margin of the south China block. An additional supply from the Emeishan magmatic province and/or the Yidun arc is suggested by the paucity of white mica in the southern Songpan-Ganzi deposystem. Mica ages of Rhaetian sediments from the northwestern Sichuan basin best correlate with those of the Triassic QTHD orogen. Our Si-in-white mica data demonstrate that the high- and ultrahigh-pressure rocks of the Hong'an-Dabie Shan were not exposed in the Middle to Late Triassic.},

   abstract = {This article reports the depositional environment, provenance, and U-Pb zircon age constraints for the newly identified Zhaga Formation in northern Tibet and uses these to better understand the tectonic evolution of the Bangong-Nujiang suture. One transect across the Zhaga Formation was investigated. The Zhaga Formation is ~2km thick, dominated by greywacke and conglomerate at the base, basalt and limestone in the middle, and greywacke and shale at the top. Greywacke in the Zhaga Formation typically contains 70-75% quartz, 5% feldspar, 3-5% rock debris, and >15% matrix, with normal grading and convolute bedding, basal flow structures, and distinct Bouma sequences interpreted as bathyal to abyssal turbidites. One rhyolite sample and one greywacke sample from the studied transect were collected for zircon U-Pb dating. The rhyolite yields a concordia age of 118Ma, and the greywacke yields nine age peaks of 247, 330, 459, 541, 611, 941, 1590, 1871, and 2482Ma, indicating that the Zhaga Formation formed during the late Early Cretaceous and the provenance of its detritus was the Qiangtang area. These data, combined with the Early Cretaceous ocean islands, indicates that the Bangong-Nujiang Neo-Tethys Ocean must have been open during the late Early Cretaceous. We conclude that the Bangong-Nujiang Neo-Tethys Ocean closed after the late Early Cretaceous and not during the Late Jurassic or the early Early Cretaceous as proposed by previous workers.},

The DGs have high contents of SiO2, Al2O3, Na2O, and Sr, high values of Mg-#, low contents of Yb and Y, and markedly high Sr/Y ratios, indicating an adakitic affinity, and we show that they were derived from the partial melting of subducted oceanic crust. The DGs contain large numbers of inherited zircons that have similar shapes and peak ages to the detrital zircons in the accretionary wedge graywackes that surround the DGs, suggesting that many of these sediments were as-similated during the formation of the DGs. Five DG samples yield the youngest zircon U-Pb ages of 155-160 Ma, indicating that the DGs formed during the Late Jurassic. Based on the present results and regional geological data, we infer that the Bangong-Nujiang oceanic lithosphere was subducted northwards beneath the Southern Qiangtang terrane during the formation of a continental arc system during the Late Jurassic. The Bangong-Nujiang oceanic lithosphere retreated rapidly after its initial subduction, and the Southern Qiangtang terrane to the north of the Bangong-Nujiang Ocean acquired a massive amount of new oceanic material in the form of an accretionary wedge. This wedge, which included the DOs and the Mugagangri Group, became sufficiently large (both in size and width) for arc-type magmas (DGs) to develop within it during the Late Jurassic.

   abstract = {Timing of the opening of the Meso-Tethys Ocean, represented by the Bangong-Nujiang Suture Zone on the Tibetan Plateau, remains controversial. Further research is required to understand the breakup of the northern Gondwana margin and the tectonic evolution of the Tethyan realm. In this study, we present petrography, U-Pb dating and Hf isotopic data for detrital zircons from Upper Carboniferous-Upper Permian strata in the South Qiangtang Terrane on the Tibetan Plateau. These data, together with data from previous literature, indicate a youngest detrital zircon age peak of ca. 550 Ma for Upper Carboniferous-Lower Permian strata. This is far older than the depositional age of ca. 300 Ma and indicates a source in the stable Gondwana Continent. Upper Permian strata yield younger ages (490-247 Ma) with peaks at ca. 460, 355, 290 and 260 Ma, indicating a source in the active South Qiangtang Terrane. Combined with the unconformity between the Lower and Upper Permian strata in the western South Qiangtang Terrane, we conclude that a significant change in sedimentary provenance occurred at 280-260 Ma. This provenance change might have resulted from the 300-279 Ma rifting magmatism on the northern Indian margin of Gondwana (e.g., South Qiangtang). The 300-279 Ma magmatism is interpreted to reflect the early stages of rifting, and the subsequent 280-260 Ma sedimentary provenance change is interpreted as the later stage, both of which established a complete Early-Middle Permian (300-260 Ma) rifting process that marks the opening of the Meso-Tethys Ocean.},

   abstract = {The Upper Triassic Langjiexue Group, which lies immediately south of the Yarlung-Tsangpo Suture Zone in the Shannan area of southeastern Tibet, represents an important part of the Tethyan Himalayan Sequence (THS). Its provenance and palaeogeography have been the subject of debate. We present new data on petrographic composition, whole-rock geochemistry, and detrital zircon U-Pb geochronology to constrain the provenance of the Langjiexue Group. The dominance of quartz grains and felsic volcanic lithic fragments suggests that the sandstones are litho-quartzose. The trace element geochemical signatures (V-Ni-Th*10, Co/Th-La/Sc, Eu/Eu*-Th/Sc) suggest derivation from felsic igneous sources. The detrital zircon age spectra display three major peaks: a Meso-to-Neoproterozoic peak (1200-900Ma, 7-18%), a Neoproterozoic-to-Late Cambrian peak (750-500 Ma, 32-65%), and a Late Carboniferous-toLate Triassic peak (300-200Ma, 11-33%). The maximum depositional age of early Carnian (236-235Ma) is obtained by calculating weighted average ages of the youngest zircons (<= 250 Ma). The youngest age cluster (300-200 Ma) is incompatible with sources from neighbouring terranes, including the South Qiangtang terrane, Lhasa terrane, THS, and Higher Himalayan Crystalline. Correlations of the Permian-Triassic zircons with those of time-equivalent strata in northwest Australia, west Burma, and the Banda Arc unveil a potential connection to the Tasmanides along the convergent margin of eastern Australia. The New England Orogen (300-230 Ma) could have supplied the Langjiexue Group with magmatic materials via continent-scale drainage systems or a submarine fan complex. This scenario provides a new perspective into the transport of detritus from distal orogens to sedimentary basins thousands of kilometres away.

   abstract = {The modern Tianshan Mountains and their surrounding basins have mainly been shaped by the far field effects of the Cenozoic India-Asia collision. However, precollision topographic evolution of the Tianshan Mountains and its impacts on the Junggar and Turpan Basins remain unclear due to the scarcity of data. Detrital zircon U-Pb dating of 14 new and 23 published samples from Permian to Neogene strata in the northern Western Tianshan Mountains, northern and southern Bogda Mountains and Central Turpan Basin, are combined with sedimentary characteristics (lithofacies, petrofacies and paleocurrent data) to investigate the temporal and spatial changes in sediment provenances. Based on the age characteristics of the source rocks in the Tianshan Mountains, the detrital zircons are divided into three groups: pre-Carboniferous zircons, mainly from the Central Tianshan Mountains; Carboniferous to Permian zircons, mainly from the North Tianshan and Bogda Mountains; and Mesozoic zircons, mainly from syn-depositional volcanic activity. The topographic evolution of the Tianshan Mountains and their relation to the Junggar and Turpan Basins can be generally divided into six stages. (1) Positive-relief Tianshan and Bogda Mountains and a rifted marine basin formed during the Early Permian to early Middle Permian following late Carboniferous orogenesis, as evidenced by interbedded alluvial fan conglomerates and postcollisional extension-related volcanic rocks along the basin margins, by marine deposits far from the basin margins and by the predominance of Carboniferous to Permian detrital zircons. (2) Fluvial to lacustrine deposits in the modern southern Junggar and Turpan Basins are characterized by abundant pre-Carboniferous zircons and consistently northward-flowing paleocurrents, indicating the submergence of the Bogda Mountains and a contiguous Junggar-Turpan continental depression basin during the late Middle Permian to the Triassic. (3) The Bogda Mountains began to uplift in the Early Jurassic, resulting in opposing paleocurrent directions, a sudden increase in sedimentary lithic detritus and the dominance of Carboniferous to Permian detrital zircons along the southern and northern margins of this range. (4) In contrast to the uplift of the Bogda Mountains, the other parts of the Tianshan Mountains experienced gradual peneplanation from the Early Jurassic to the Middle Jurassic, as confirmed by widespread fluvial to lacustrine deposits, even inside the modern Tianshan Mountains, and by the dominance of pre-Carboniferous detrital zircons. (5) The dominance of Carboniferous to Permian zircons in the southern Junggar Basin suggests the West Tianshan Mountains were uplifted during the Late Jurassic, while the dominance of pre-Carboniferous zircons in the Central Turpan Basin indicates continuous peneplanation in the Eastern Tianshan Mountains. (6) The initial shape of the Tianshan Mountains-Junggar Basin-Turpan Basin system was constructed in the Late Jurassic but was modified in the Cenozoic by the India-Asia collision, resulting in much higher Western Tianshan and Bogda Mountains, low Eastern Tianshan Mountains and well-developed foreland basins. These Cenozoic changes were recorded by the rapid cooling of apatites, the dominance of Carboniferous to Permian zircons in the southern Junggar Basin and northern Turpan Basin, and the dominance of pre-Carboniferous zircons in the Central Turpan Basin.

The OligoceneMiocene sediments in the Subei Basin, an intermontane basin situated at the junction of the central and southern QSOB, provide direct insight into the Cenozoic deformation of the QSOB. Here, a comprehensive provenance study based on detrital zircon geochronology, paleocurrents, conglomerate components and sedimentary facies in the Subei Basin demonstrates that this region experienced three stages of tectonic events during the Cenozoic. (1) Oligocene strata contain zircons of 200-300, 400-500, 700-1000, 1600-2000 and 2400-2700 Ma, indicating primary derivation from recycled Mesozoic sedimentary rocks in the QSOB and suggesting early Cenozoic deformation in this region. (2) One sample (21.5 Ma) yields similar age populations to those of Oligocene samples, except for the complete disappearance of 200-300 Ma zircons as a result of the widespread deformation of the QSOB. (3) Two samples (18.5-13.6 Ma) show a unimodal age cluster at 400-500 Ma, while one sample (9 Ma) contains zircon ages similar to those of Oligocene samples, indicating tectonic uplift of the southern QSOB in the middle-late Miocene, which is also recorded by the sedimentary transition from fluvial to alluvial fan. Based on these findings and those of previous studies, we suggest that the entire QSOB has undergone multistage tectonic events since the early Cenozoic due to far-field effects associated with the India-Eurasia plate collision and the continued convergence.},

New detrital zircon U-Pb geochronology and paleocurrent data from Eocene formations in this basin suggest that the sediment sources switched from the remote sources (including Hoh-Xil, Songpan-Ganzi, North Qiangtang, Yidun and western Yangtze terranes) to local lithologies (adjacent Triassic and Eocene igneous rocks and western Yangtze block) from the early-middle Eocene Baoxiangsi to the late Eocene Shuanghe and Jianchuan Formations. Such provenance changes support that large-scale drainage reorganization occurred in the late Eocene (prior to similar to 36 Ma). This significant late Eocene provenance and drainage changes occurred as one of the responses to coeval topographic uplift in the southeastern Tibetan Plateau.},

   abstract = {The process and mechanism of deformation in the northeastern Tibetan Plateau (NETP) are significant for understanding the remote effects of the India-Eurasia collision. Although increasingly more research has extensively addressed the post-Oligocene NETP growth history over the past two decades, geological dating of early Cenozoic sediments remains sparse, hampering our understanding of early-stage tectonic growth in this region. Here, we present magnetostratigraphic results from the oldest sedimentary record between -54 and 40 Ma in the western part of the Linxia Basin based on correlation with the geomagnetic polarity time scale. This age exceeds that of the oldest strata previously known (29 Ma) and has great potential for recording paleoclimatic and paleontological evolution in the fossil-rich Linxia Basin. Integrating our paleomagnetic chronology, sedimentary facies, accumulation rate, and provenance results reveals that early-stage Linxia Basin development was associated with Eocene growth of the West Qinling. The U-Pb age distributions of detrital grains from pre-51 Ma strata are characterized by many 200-300 Ma ages; alluvial fans and north-directed paleocurrent data indicate a single and relatively proximal source. The northern segment of the West Qinling was the predominant source supplying sediments to the Linxia Basin before -51 Ma. Subsequently, a pronounced increase in the sedimentation rate at -51 Ma and southward migration of the sedimentary system during 51-47.8 Ma demonstrate that extension and fast exhumation of the sediment source occurred. Detrital zircon U-Pb age spectra since -51 Ma reveal significant increases in Precambrian peaks (1500-2000 Ma and 2300-2600 Ma). These observations suggest accelerated growth of the southern segment of the West Qinling and/or eastern segment of the East Kunlun Shan between 51 and 47.8 Ma. The Eocene basin evolution and accelerated uplift of ranges in the NETP imply near-synchronicity of crustal shortening and deformation across the entire India-Eurasia collision zone.

   abstract = {Pearl River Mouth Basin (PRMB) is a typical episodically rifting basin, and its sediment records exhibit a multistage infilling process. To build the coupling relationship between the spatial variability of tectonic movement and sediment dispersal pattern, we character the source-to-sink system distribution within continental margin and analysis their dominated factors with quantitative statistical methods. First, we identify the faults and calculate the rifting rate by interpreting the two-dimensional (2D) seismic data and zircon or apatite fissiontrack data (ZFT/AFT). Accordingly, based on the various trending of the rifting rate evolution, we classified rifting process episodically into three patterns: accelerated rifting decelerated rifting, and uniform rifting. Then, we integrated the data available on detrital zircon U?Pb, rare earth element, and heavy mineral assemblage to identify the responding S2S components associated with the above various rifting processes. Results show that in the first tectonic stage during the early Eocene, the sediments were mainly sourced from an intrabasin provenance area, whereas in the late Eocene to the Oligocene, the paleo-Pearl River provided the sediments to the sink area. We restore the facies association of the sink area by studying the core samples, electric well logs, and threedimensional (3D) seismic data. During the accelerated and uniform rifting processes, coarse-grained deposited along the boundary faults, which includes the fan delta and subaqueous fans. During decelerated rifting, the depositional environment was dominated by braided channels, meandering channels, and tide-influenced channel accretion. Based on the quantitative analysis the relationship between the grain size of the sediment in each S2S segment and the rifting rate, more fine-grained components were preserved in the decelerated rifting system, while coarse-grained sediments fill the accelerated rifting depression and uniform rifting components. Furthermore, the sediment supply and relative height can influence the volume of the S2S system in the uniform rifting system. In the decelerated rifting basin, the sediment supply is the major factor associated with the development of S2S, whereas the relative height is the major factor associated with the accelerated rifting basin.},

   abstract = {Developed on the North China Craton, the intracratonic Ordos Basin contains a complete Paleozoic-to-Cenozoic sediment record, allowing for long-term paleoenvironmental and climate change investigation. During the Carboniferous-Permian period, convergence between the North China block and the paleo-Yangtze plate to the south resulted in a general marine regression characterized by a series of second-order transgression/regression cycles diachronous along the eastern margin of the Ordos. However, the detailed mechanisms that induced these cycles, as well as the associated paleoecological changes, remain unknown. In this study, we integrate multiple indices, including delta 18O and delta 13C, rare earth element (REE), paleontological assemblages, and clay content (w (chlorite + kaolinite)/w((Illite) ratio) planar distribution, to restore the paleo-water depth distribution. These parameters are then used to reconstruct the paleo-sea level from the Pennsylvanian to the middle Permian. We conclude that the direction of second-order transgression/regression was mainly toward the east during the Pennsylvanian-early Permian and switched clockwise toward the north during the middle Permian. We suggest that the second-order cycles, diachronous in space and time, are mainly linked to local variations in sediment supply and regional uplift. Using detrital zircon U-Pb data and the REE and trace element content and heavy mineral assemblages (HMA), we estimate the sediment provenance area. The sediment volumes deposited in the basin through time are obtained using 2D seismic data. During the Carboniferous, the coarse-grained sediments deposited in the eastern Ordos were derived from the uplifting Helan Mountain (Qiandam-Qilian orogenic belt). By the middle Permian, the detrital material became multi-sourced, thus issuing the Yinshan range to the north and the Qinling range to the south. We then integrate the description of numerous core samples with electric log and 2D seismic data to reconstruct the sediment facies associations across the first-order regression from the Carboniferous tidal flat depositional system to the middle Permian prograding fluvial delta system. According to the transfer of the glacial epoch, the sedimentation rate, and the transgression/regression rate above, we classify the evolution process into three patterns: low-transgression rate and less-sediment supply pattern (the late Carboniferous), high regression rate and mass sediment supply pattern (the north block during the early Permian), and low regression rate and mass sediment supply pattern (the south block during the Sakmarian stage). Lastly, with the quantitative calculation of the source-to-sink (S2S) parameters, including the S2S system volume and the elevated height of regional uplift with the 2D seismic data, we propose the mechanism of transgression/regression in the Ordos Basin, responding to the above three pattern s. The first pattern was controlled by regional uplift, whereas the second pattern was controlled by sediment supply. As to the third one, uplift and sediment supply could affect the transgression/regression process.y},

   abstract = {Recognition of accretionary tectonics in ancient orogenic collages is important for reconstructing the long-term subduction, accretion, and erosional history of fossil convergent margins, and for understanding crustal growth and supercontinent assembly. The North Qilian orogenic belt (NQOB), located between the Alxa block and the Central Qilian-Qaidam block in northeastern Tibet, is a typical Phanerozoic accretionary-to-collisional orogenic belt that represents the termination of the northern branch of the Proto-Tethys Ocean. It contains two subparallel ophiolitic belts, arcs, and subduction complexes; the ophiolitic rocks in the northern belt have generally been considered to have formed in a back-arc setting. However, the subduction-accretion-collision history, subduction polarity, and timing of closure of the back-arc ocean remain equivocal. To address these problems, we conducted detailed field, structural, and geochronological investigations of the Laohushan ophiolite-accretionary complex and related sedimentary rocks in the eastern NQOB. The Laohushan Complex is divisible into (1) a northern sedimentary forearc, and a supra-subduction zone-type ultramafic-mafic forearc (ca. 450 Ma) composed of serpentinized harzburgite, gabbro, basalt, and plagiogranite; and (2) a southern accretionary complex, which consists of relatively coherent basalt-chert-mudstone ocean plate stratigraphy that is structurally repeated many times, trench-fill turbidites, melanges, and widespread thrust imbricates and duplexes, block-in-matrix and asymmetric structures. Kinematic analysis indicates that the accretionary complex underwent southward thrusting and shearing; coupled with the spatial architecture of the different tectonic units, which suggests northward subduction beneath the northern forearc on the southern margin of the Alxa block. Detrital zircon ages of forearc clastic sandstones, pelagic mudstones, trench-fill turbidites, and the matrix of melanges, together with the zircon ages of igneous ophiolitic rocks and post-accretionary intrusions, indicate that the terminal accretion and tectonic stacking of the Laohushan subduction complex was between ca. 447 and 430 Ma. We propose a geodynamic model involving back-arc basin opening (ca. 517-449 Ma), intra-oceanic subduction-accretion (ca. 449-430 Ma), and final obduction of the northern forearc to account for the evolutionary processes of the North Qilian back-arc basin. The anatomy of the forearc ophiolite and structurally lower accretionary complex indicates the complicated origins and mechanism of emplacement of the ophiolitic rocks. Field-based reconstruction of accretionary complexes and upper plate ophiolites, together with provenance analysis of related sedimentary sequences, provide crucial constraints on the prolonged evolution of paleo-ocean basins and accretionary-to-collisional orogens.},

   abstract = {The history of convergence between the India and the Asia plates, and of their subsequent collision which triggered the Himalayan orogeny is recorded in the Yarlung Zangbo suture zone. Exposed along the southern side of the suture, turbidites of the the Jiachala Formation fed largely from the Gangdese arc have long been considered as post-collisional foreland-basin deposits based on the reported occurrence of Paleocene-early Eocene dinoflagellate cysts and pollen assemblages. Because magmatic activity in the Gangdese arc continued through the Late Cretaceous and Paleogene, this scenario is incompatible with U-Pb ages of detrital zircons invariably older than the latest Cretaceous. To solve this conundrum, we carried out detailed stratigraphic, sedimentological, paleontological, and provenance analyses in the Gyangze and Sajia areas of southern Tibet, China. The Jiachala Formation consists of submarine fan deposits that lie in fault contact with the Zongzhuo Formation. Sandstone petrography together with U-Pb ages and Hf isotope ratios of detrital zircons indicate provenance from the Gangdese arc and central Lhasa terrane. Well preserved pollen or dinoflagellate cysts microfossils were not found in spite of careful research, and the youngest age obtained from zircon grain was similar to 84 Ma. Based on sedimentary facies, provenance analysis and tectonic position, we suggest that the Jiachala Formation was deposited during the Late Cretaceous (similar to 88-84 Ma) in the trench formed along the southern edge of Asia during subduction of Neo-Tethyan oceanic lithosphere.},

   abstract = {Neogene reservoir sand in the Yinggehai-Song Hong (YGH-SHB) and Qiongdongnan basins (QDNB) was derived from the Red River, Hainan Island and the Vietnamese Truong Son Belt. We investigate the sand dispersal pathways through comparisons of detrital zircon geochronology and heavy mineral analyses of modern Vietnamese river sand, Holocene to Recent near-coastal sand from Hainan Island and Vietnam and offshore Neogene sand, and we evaluate the methodologies. Eleven distinct zircon age clusters characterize the Gulf of Tonkin provenances. Red River sand contains the most complex age pattern with similar to 35Ma, similar to 88Ma,similar to 155Ma, similar to 250Ma, similar to 440Ma peaks and broader pre-Cambrian clusters. The similar to 88Ma peak uniquely occurs in Red River sand. Northern Truong Son Belt sand contains similar to 35Ma, similar to 250Ma, similar to 440Ma peaks and pre-Cambrian clusters comparable to the Red River. The lack of Cretaceous zircons and a high proportion of similar to 250Ma relative to similar to 440Ma zircons distinguishes the northern Truong Son Belt from the Red River. The southern Truong Son Belt is characterized by low proportions of similar to 250Ma relative to similar to 440Ma zircons and the absence of Cretaceous and Cenozoic zircons. Hainan Island sand is identified by the presence of similar to 100 Ma zircons and the absence of Cenozoic and similar to 88 Ma zircons. The zircon age patterns suggest simple, although dynamic, sand dispersal pathways with mixed sand sources over much of the basins likely resulting from sediment reworking and downstream river merging induced by Neogene sea-level fluctuations. Sand in the western YGH-SHB was mainly sourced from the Truong Son Belt, the Red River sourced the northern and central YGH-SHB and QDNB, and Hainan sand was primarily deposited along the island margin. Heavy mineral compositions in the Gulf of Tonkin primarily reflect sediment compositional maturity. Epidote, amphibole, pyroxene and garnet indicate immaturity, whereas a high zircon content tends to indicate high maturity. The use of heavy minerals as provenance indicator should proceed with the utmost caution.},

   abstract = {The significant Late Mesozoic thinning of lithospheric mantle in eastern China caused the formation of many basins and intensive volcanism. Crust exhumation process is a crucial part of supracrust response of lithosphere destruction. It has been studied in order to constrain the model of Late Mesozoic thinning of lithospheric mantle. The Sulu orogenic belt and the Jiaobei Terrane underwent a substantial exhumation process in Early Cretaceous, and though many studies have been carried out to investigate its exhumation history, it is still lacking understanding. Extensional terrestrial domain of the Jiaolai Basin was formed along with the Early Cretaceous exhumation of the Jiaobei Terrane and the Sulu orogenic belt. It provides an ideal research object for studying the exhumation process of Jiaodong Peninsula in Early Cretaceous because of the continuous sedimentary record in the basin. In this study, we analysed detrital zircon geochronology of three sandstone samples from Early Cretaceous sediments in north-eastern part of the Jiaolai Basin. Detrital zircon age spectrums indicate that zircon ages consist mainly of six clusters, and they comprise Neoarchean ages, Palaeoproterozoic ages, Neoproterozoic ages, Triassic ages, Jurassic ages, and Early Cretaceous ages. The study shows that the Jiaobei Terrane and the Sulu orogenic belt served as source areas that provided detrital materials for Early Cretaceous strata in the Jiaolai Basin. Our results, along with those of previous studies, suggest that Jiaobei Terrane and the Sulu orogenic belt in Jiaodong Peninsula had discrepant exhumation history in Early Cretaceous.},

However, its depositional age, provenance and tectonic setting remain controversial. We address these issues through studies of petrography, geochemistry and detrital zircon U-Pb ages on the Hengdan Group sandstones. The Hengdan Group sandstones have low compositional and textural maturity and experienced low degree of chemical weathering and sediment recycling. They were mainly sourced from proximal acidic to intermediate arc-related igneous rocks, and their modal compositions, trace elemental contents (i.e., La, Ce, Th, and FREE) and ratios (i.e., La-N/ Yb N and Eu/Eu*) are comparable to those deposited in an active continental margin. Detrital zircons from the Hengdan Group sandstones yield similar unimodal age distributions at 950-740 Ma, with the youngest age clusters at ca. 730 Ma. Combining with previous work, the Hengdan Group was most likely deposited during ca. 733-717 Ma in a forearc basin and its primary provenance was probably from the nearby arc-related acidic to intermediate igneous rocks. In addition, the northwestern margin of the Yangtze Block was most likely in an active continental margin setting between ca. 835 and 720 Ma, and hence the slab retreating during a long-term oceanic subduction is favored as the dominant breakup driving force in the supercontinental margin(s).},

This research has reported the geochemical and geochronological studies on the sandstones in the Hengdan Group. Our work indicates that the sandstones in the Hengdan Group experienced low degree of chemical weathering and sedimentary recycling, and are mainly sourced from acidic to intermediate igneous rocks. In addition, their elemental contents (i.e., La, Ce, Th and Sigma REE) and ratios (i.e., La-N/Yb-N and Eu/Eu*) are comparable to those deposited in an active continental margin setting. All samples yield similar age distribution, having a dominated age range at ca. 850 to 720 Ma. Together with the dominantly angular to subangular morphology and clear oscillatory or broad zoning internal structure of these aged detrital zircons, indicating that the Hengdan Group should be proximally sourced from the early to middle Neoproterozoic igneous rocks. In addition, the youngest group of detrital zircon U-Pb ages of the sandstones in the Hengdan Group suggest that the onset and ending of the deposition of this group is later than ca. 741 Ma and ca. 722 Ma, respectively. Combining with previous work, the Hengdan Group was most likely deposited during ca. 741 to 717 Ma in a forearc basin setting at the northwestern margin of the YB, and with its primary provenance probably from nearby acidic to intermediate igneous rocks. In addition, all these above further supports that the northwestern margin of the YB should be a long-lived active continental margin setting during early to middle Neoproterozoic (ca. 835 to 717 Ma) and, the South China Block should be located at the relative peripheral location of the Rodinia supercontinent.},

   abstract = {The Ulugqat Basin is located at the juncture of the Tarim Basin, the western Tianshan Orogen of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt, and the Pamir salient of the Tethys domain. A comprehensive provenance study using sedimentology, petrology, and detrital zircon U-Pb geochronology was carried out on the clastic rocks of the fifth member of the Lower Cretaceous Kezilesu Group from the Ulugqat Basin, aiming to better understand the nature of its relationships with the neighbouring tectonic units as well as the formation of sandstone-hosted Zn-Pb mineralization. The fifth member consists of conglomerate, gravelly sandstone, sandstone, and mudstone interbeds, and is interpreted as alluvial fan-braid river-braid river delta sediments. The conglomerate and gravelly sandstone contain different kinds of lithic fragments, including phyllite, quartzite, chert, chalcedony, and some felsic igneous rocks, with low compositional maturities. The detrital zircon U-Pb ages of sandstone from the uppermost part of the fifth member range widely from 229.7 to 2,984.9 Ma, concentratedly distributed in five groups: 230-300, 390-480, 750-880, 1,600-2,200, and 2,300-3,000 Ma. The identified palaeocurrent directions, heavy mineral assemblages, specific provenance indicators, and distributions of detrital zircon U-Pb ages all indicate that these clastic rocks are probably sourced from the South Tianshan Orogen to the north, rather than the Pamir salient, probably involving the Proterozoic Aksu metamorphic rocks, Palaeozoic sedimentary rocks, Late Carboniferous-Early Permian alkali granite, and some mafic/ultramafic rocks of ophiolitic melange. This interpretation is consistent with a late Early Cretaceous uplifting of the South Tianshan Orogen according to previous low-temperature thermochronological data sets. The thick deposition of these Lower Cretaceous clastic rocks and associated uplifting of the South Tianshan Orogen are interpreted to be related to the coeval collision of the Karakoram-Lhasa Block with the southern Asian margin.},

   abstract = {The Qilian Orogenic Belt (QOB) in Northwest China consists of three distinct terranes: North Qilian, Central Qilian, and South Qilian, which have experienced complex rifting and converging. Here, we present new U-Pb ages and Hf isotopes of detrital zircons from the Neoproterozoic and Mesoproterozoic sedimentary rocks in the QOB to constrain the tectonic affinity of the different terranes and provide new evidence to the transition from Columbia to Rodinia. Two Mesoproterozoic zircon samples from the North and the Central Qilian display similar age spectra with a dominant population varying from 1.21 Ga to 1.78 Ga. The population show two age peaks at similar to 1.5 Ga and similar to 1.75 Ga and have same range of epsilon(Hf)(t) values from- 9.1 to +9.8. Except for this population, the rest zircons yield Paleoproterozoic or even older ages with a peak at similar to 2.45 Ga. These results suggest that the three terranes were once of a united block in the late Mesoproterozoic. The two Neoproterozoic samples from the Central Qilian and the South Qilian both have a main population of ages at 0.85-1.0 Ga and a minor population peaked at similar to 2.45 Ga. Their zircon epsilon(Hf)(t) values indicated that the source rocks of the main population were dominantly composed of recycled crustal materials. Because of the comparable and homogeneous age patterns and Hf isotopic compositions of Proterozoic detrital zircons, the QOB has a close relationship to South China from Mesoproterozoic to Early Neoproterozoic. Our zircon ages and Hf isotopic data indicate that the juvenile components increased at 1.6-1.2 Ga, which response to an exterior orogen that newly-formed crust has replaced the lower crust possibly triggered by slab retreat or upwelling of asthenosphere materials related to the breakup of Columbia. In contrast, the abundant addition of the reworking materials at 1.2-0.8 Ga reacts to an interior orogen characteristic because continental collision was involved in the convergent of Rodinia. This changing, therefore, was a response to the transition from breakup of Columbia to the assembly of Rodinia.},

   abstract = {Pingdingshan sandstone is a prominent symbol in the upper part of Late Paleozoic strata of North China Block. It is well known for its extensive distribution, special lithology and significant division of sedimentary lithology for the Late Paleozoic strata, suggesting that Pingdingshan sandstone may record a remarkable geological event, however, its sedimentary age and sedimentary environment have always been the focus of controversy for a long time. In this study, samples are selected from the named place of Pingdingshan sandstone in the southern part of North China Block (i. e. Pingdingshan area, Gongyi area and Yiyang area) for LA-ICPMS U-Pb dating of detrital zircons, assisted by Hf isotopes analysis, with the attempt to determine the maximum sedimentary age and the material source area, expecting to provide basis for confirming the sedimentary age and sedimentary environment. The results show that the detrital zircons from four samples of the Pingdingshan sandstone in Pingdingshan, Gongyi and Yiyang areas in the southern part of North China Block, are mainly from the Palaeozoic magmatic zircons and the Precambrian metamorphic zircons. Among them, the Paleozoic zircons account for 13% with the peak age of similar to 259Ma, similar to 318Ma and similar to 435Ma, while the Precambrian zircons account for 87% with distinct peak ages of 1871Ma and 2459Ma, along with two very inconspicuous peak age of similar to 812Ma and similar to 976Ma which is composed by only three zircons. By using the youngest single detrital zircons ages ( YSG) of four samples, 249 8Ma, 260 7Ma, 252 7Ma and 248 7Ma, respectively, which is close to the Permian/Triassic boundary age 251 O. 4Ma, we limit the maximum sedimentary age of the stratum and presume that the bottom of Pingdingshan sandstone may be a contact boundary between Permian and Triassic, i. e., the geological age of the Pingdingshan sandstone in the southern part of North China Block should belong to Early Triassic. Based on analysis of the sedimentary and tectonic setting of Pingdingshan sandstone, accompanied by the comparison with age spectrum and eHf ( t) of the potential material source areas, the main material sources of Pingdingshan sandstone are from the Late Paleozoic intrusive rocks and the metamorphic basement of North China Block in the Inner Mongolia Uplift at the northern part of North China Block, while a few material sources are from the Caledonian middle -acid granitic intrusive rocks and the main metamorphic strata ( Qinling Group, ErlangPing Group and Kuanping Group) in northern Qinling Orogenic Belt. Based on the analysis of the maximum sedimentary ages and sources of Pingdingshan sandstone, with the facts that the provenances of the lower strata ( Shanxi Formation, Xiashihezi Formation and Shangshihezi Formation) are almost all from the Inner Mongolia Uplift in the northern part of North China Block, and the provenances of the upper strata of Shiqianfeng Formation ( except Pingdingshan sandstone) mainly from the North Qinling orogenic belt, it is inferred that the Pingdingshan sandstone may be a record of the sedimentary and tectonic environment change between Permian and Triassic in the southern part of the North China Block.},

   abstract = {Widespread Paleoproterozoic supracrustal rocks in the northern Tarim Craton contain important information about its geological evolution and correlation with adjacent blocks. We present new in situ LA-(MC-)ICP-MS zircon U-Pb and Lu-Hf isotopic data for six mica schist samples from the Korla Complex. Field and petrological studies indicate a pelitic to semi-pelitic protolith and a high pressure upper amphibolite-facies peak metamorphic condition (T = 690 +/- 50 degrees C and P = 11 +/- 2 kbar) for these samples. CL-images reveal that zircons in these samples are dominantly metamorphic origin and only a few detrital zircons occur as relics in sample T1, the ages of which suggest a maximum deposition age of ca. 2.0 Ga and a sedimentary provenance from the Tarim Craton itself. All metamorphic zircons consistently record a metamorphic age of ca. 1.85 Ga, despite of various degrees of discordance probably due to later Pb-loss. Both recrystallization and new zircon growth are recognized for the genesis of these metamorphic zircons. The metamorphic zircon domains in sample T1 show a relatively large range of initial Hf-176/Hf-177 ratios similar to the detrital cores, whereas those in the other samples show similar initial Hf-176/Hf-177 ratios (ca. 0.28140 +/- 0.00010, 2 sigma) regardless of their internal structures and degrees of discordance. The former is interpreted as a result of complete U-Pb resetting through fluid-mediated recrystallization, whereas the later probably implies a large-scale Hf isotopic homogenization during new zircon growth. Petrological and zircon isotopic evidence supports that the new zircon growth and Hf isotopic homogenization probably resulted from the mixing of Hf-Zr derived from dissolution of tiny detrital zircons and decomposition of garnet to chlorite in hydrothermal fluids during retrograde metamorphism. Accordingly, the ages of these new zircon growths may postdate the peak metamorphism, which was probably related to a late Paleoproterozoic collisional orogenic event in the northern Tarim Craton. A compilation of available geological and geochronological data enables us to identify two Late Paleoproterozoic orogenic belts: the ca. 1.9-1.8 Ga North Tarim Orogen and the ca. 2.0-1.9 Ga South Tarim Orogen. It is suggested that the Tarim Craton, including the Dunhuang and Quanji Blocks, was correlative with the Alxa-Yinshan Block of the North China Craton, and they probably formed a coherent massif during the Neoarchean-early Paleoproterozoic, which collided with the Ordos Block and its western extension along the ca. 1.95 Ga Khondalite Belt-South Tarim Orogen to form a larger landmass in the Columbia Supercontinent.

   abstract = {Lower Paleozoic successions of the Gobi-Altai zone of southern Mongolia record an abrupt facies transition from deposition of predominantly fine-grained uppermost Ordovician through lowermost Devonian carbonate and marl facies to deposition of coarse clastic strata of the Lower Devonian Tsakhir Formation. The Tsakhir generally fines upward from alluvial-fan cobble and pebble conglomerate to interbedded coarse-and fine-grained marine siliciclastic and carbonate strata, which were deposited within a tectonically active basin. The marine strata, deposited in a storm-influenced proximal to distal fan delta, include unusual event beds that grade from pebble conglomerate to hummocky cross-stratified grainstone and sandstone. These beds represent sediment emplaced by gravity flows during flood events and reworked by large gravity waves associated with storm events. The interpreted link between flood deposition and storm wave reworking supports a hyper pycnal flow interpretation for these deposits.
The sudden facies transition at the base of the formation represents the sedimentological and stratigraphic signature of Early Devonian tectonism in the Gobi-Altai zone. The general upward-fining pattern of the Tsakhir is interpreted as a response to the creation of accommodation space at a greater rate than progradation of the fan delta, in large part due to tectonic subsidence, although some component of eustasy may have been involved. The production of steep relief and deposition of associated volcanics suggest a transition from relatively passive deposition to active tectonics in this region during the Lochkovian to Pragian stages of the Early Devonian. We herein introduce the term "Tsakhir event" for this important tectonic transition. Range-bounding faults for this event are not preserved, but alluvial-fan deposition, the development of unconformities, renewed subsidence, and magmatism throughout the Gobi-Altai zone all suggest syndepositional tectonism.
Detrital zircon spectra from both Ordovician and Devonian strata contain Archean to Paleozoic ages. Minor differences between Ordovician and Devonian samples suggest changes in source regions and/or transport paths prior to, and after, the Tsakhir event. The paleoenvironmental setting of the Tsakhir Formation requires short transport distances, and thus the age spectrum of a sample from this formation represents proximal basement rocks of the Shine Jinst region of the Gobi-Altai zone. Basement rocks are not exposed in the Shine Jinst region, but the wide variety of ages in all of the detrital spectra suggest a nearby continental source.
Our detrital age spectra contain peaks that coincide with basement ages and magmatic events on the adjacent Mongolian microcontinent and also have strong similarities with recently published spectra of nearby landmasses in Neoproterozoic to Paleozoic paleogeographic reconstructions, namely, Siberia, North China, eastern Gondwana, and Tarim. These similarities extend to spectra of late Neoproterozoic to middle Paleozoic rocks throughout Gondwanaland and also Siberia, illustrating the somewhat limited utility of detrital spectra for determining the tectonic affinities of crustal blocks at this time in Earth history.},

   abstract = {The Xikang Group represents the main stratigraphic sequence of the Songpan-Ganzi complex (SGC), a flysch basin with a wide distribution and monotonous lithology. Strong tectonic deformation and accumulation of folds have led to destruction of the original sedimentary sequence and sedimentary structure of the strata, such that there exists no reasonable sedimentary model that can explain the massive flysch. Herein, we investigated in detail the sedimentary structures, paleocurrent direction, particle sizes, major and trace elements, and magmatic zircon and detrital zircon U-Pb ages of the typical sections of the Xikang Group in the eastern SGC. Our analysis led to the following findings: 1) The U-Pb zircon ages from the Galazi (215.6 +/- 1.1 Ma), Sudi (214.5 +/- 1.5 Ma and 221.1 +/- 1.5 Ma), and Gulu (221.3 +/- 1.2 Ma) plutons, which intrude the Xikang Group, and detrital zircon samples from the uppermost part of the Xinduqiao Fm. indicated the youngest mean age (YC1 sigma[2+]) of 222.4 +/- 2.5 Ma. This in turn indicates a pre-221 Ma depositional age for the Xikang Group. 2) The provenance was derived from the North China Block and Qiangtang Terrane, Qinling-Dabie orogenic belt, South China Block, and East Kunlun-Qaidam, and the construction of the flysch in the SGC belongs to the multi-source or line source provided by the peripheral orogenic belt. 3) Trace elements suggested that the Xikang Group may have been deposited in a sedimentary basin associated with a continental island arc. 4) The sedimentary environment in this area belonged to the distal fan of a submarine, and the new sedimentation age and sedimentation rate indicate that the Carnian pluvial event may have been the trigger mechanism. 5) The formation of the flysch deposition in SGC related to the Paleo-Tethys Ocean underwent a scissor-like closure from east to west.},

   abstract = {The Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP), which is located in the central part of China, mainly contains two sequences: the Quaternary loess-paleosol sequence and the late Miocene-Pliocene Red Clay sequence. U-Pb ages of detrital zircon from the Quaternary loess-paleosol sequences indicate that the current spatial pattern of central Asian aridification was largely established during the early Quaternary. U-Pb ages of detrital zircon from the underlying Red Clay sequences demonstrate that the northern source regions were important contributors for the dust since the late Miocene, except for the periods of similar to 8 Ma and similar to 5.5 to 4 Ma. These two periods correspond to increased and decreased dust deposition in the North Pacific, respectively, ascribed to the late Miocene aridification of the Qaidam Basin (in the west of the CLP) and the early Pliocene aridification of the Tarim Basin (in the west of the CLP). We attribute the increase of the Qaidam Basin-derived North Pacific dust fluxes to the uplift of the NE Tibetan Plateau. Such uplift also controlled the climatic and environmental changes in central Asian during the late Miocene. This study highlights the dynamical process of the central Asian aridification during the late Miocene-Pliocene. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Investigating rift basins and their provenance is difficult because their tectonic framework is continuously evolving. The Beibuwan Basin in the South China Sea is a typical rift basin that shares many characteristics of major rift basins worldwide. We present new detrital zircon U-Pb ages from the Beibuwan basin and, by combining with published data from surrounding drainages, are able to define its potential sources and to investigate its provenance evolution from the middle Eocene-lower Oligocene. Detrital zircon age spectra from distinct structural units and formations of the rift basin reveal spatial-temporal differences in provenance. In the middle-upper Eocene, a similar age pattern with major peaks at 263-253 Ma and 450-416 Ma is preserved across the basin and suggests that sediment was uniformly derived from the Yunkai Massif and Hainan Island. In contrast, during the lower Oligocene the basin displays markedly diverse ages with peaks at 250-243, 416, 756, 967-945, 1096-1084 Ma. The increase of Neoproterozoic zircons in the lower Oligocene stratum suggests that a major change in provenance occurred, most likely associated with the reorganization of the paleo-Pearl River along its central reaches due to a topography reversal associated with the uplift of Tibet and the onset of seafloor spreading in the South China Sea. Our spatial analysis of ages indicates that during the lower Oligocene, the detrital input varied across the basin. Rifting processes in the Beibuwan Basin generated multiple isolated depocenters separated by intra-basinal highs. The basin's architecture greatly affected sediment routing, with structural highs serving as barriers to sediment transport. Sediment provenance in the Beibuwan Basin is primarily controlled by drainage evolution and isolated depocenters associated with an evolving topography, processes which are relevant to the evolution of rift basins globally.

   abstract = {New geochronological and geochemical constraints on the 5000-9000 in thick Precambrian sedimentary and volcanic successions exposed along the western margin of the South China Block indicate the presence of two distinct tectonostratigraphic successions. The earliest, termed here the Laowushan Formation, comprises of volcanic rocks such as alkali basalts, breccias and tuff that are atypical of the sedimentary rocks in the previously defined Kunyang Group. A tuff within the Laowushan Formation yielded a SHRIMP U-Pb zircon age of 1142 +/- 16 Ma. The alkali basalts have a geochemical signature similar to basalts found in modern intracontinental rifts, with a uniform Nd isotopic character (epsilon Nd = -0.87 to +0.84). New U-Pb geochronology constrains the depositional age of the Kunyang Group to between ca. 1000 and 960 Ma, contemporaneous with the peak of the Sibao Orogeny. The succession largely consists of siltstone, sandstone and limestone deposited in marine, lagoonal and fluvial environments. Detrital zircon ages record changes in provenance from dominantly Archean (ca. 3570-2660 Ma) and Paleoproterozoic (ca. 1950-1800 Ma) ages in the basal and middle parts of the succession to predominately Paleoproterozoic (2140-1730 Ma) and smaller Mesoproterozoic to earliest Neoproterozoic (ca. 1500-1200 and 1093-960 Ma) components at the top of the succession. We interpret the Laowushan Formation and the Kunyang Group to be deposited during separate basin-forming events. The earliest, at ca. 1140 Ma, is interpreted to be an intracontinental rift basin, but the presence of exotic detrital grains may indicate a local early collision between the Yangtze and Cathaysia Blocks prior to the Sibao Orogeny. We suggest a tectonic scenario similar to the modern Rhine Graben where extension occurs orthogonally to the orogenic front. The traditionally defined Kunyang Group represents a foreland basin sequence which received increasingly juvenile sediments from an uplifted Sibao orogenic belt during the late Mesoproterozoic-earliest Neoproterozoic closure of the remaining ocean between the Yangtze and Cathaysia Blocks.

   abstract = {The Late Paleozoic tectonic evolution of the Lhasa terrane remains poorly understood due to the paucity of the Late Paleozoic magmatic rocks exposed at the surface. Detrital zircons in the sedimentary rocks can provide a record of magmatic rocks that have been eroded. Here we report detrital zircon U-Pb ages, trace-element and Hf isotopic data of metasedimentary rocks from the Nyingchi Complex in the eastern Himalayan syntaxis. Detrital zircons from the metasedimentary rocks yield major age populations of 330-364 Ma, 490-800 Ma, 1000-1200 Ma, and 1500-1800 Ma. The weighted mean ages of the youngest three detrital zircons indicate Carboniferous (similar to 330 Ma) depositional age for their sedimentary protoliths. Provenance analysis indicates that the sedimentary detritus was sourced from the Lhasa terrane itself. The presence of abundant 330-364 Ma detrital zircons indicates that the Lhasa terrane was characterized by Late Devonian-Early Carboniferous magmatism. The trace-element compositions of the 330-364 Ma detrital zircons indicate that their magmatic host rocks mainly include mafic rocks and granitoids, and minor carbonatite. Some mafic host rocks probably formed in rift-related tectonic setting, and the others formed in arc-related tectonic settings. The granitic host rocks were S-type granites. The 330-391 Ma zircons have negative epsilon(Hf)(t) values (-19.3 to -2.5), suggesting that their magmatic host rocks resulted from partial melting of the enriched mantle or ancient crustal materials. Combined with previous studies, we propose that the Late Devonian-Early Carboniferous magmatic rocks in the Lhasa terrane probably formed in an arc-back-arc system which resulted from the southward subduction of the Paleo-Tethys oceanic crust. The back-arc basin developed as the Sumdo Paleo-Tethys ocean, which began to shrink as oceanic crust subducted northwards underneath the North Lhasa terrane during the Late Carboniferous-Permian and finally closed during the Triassic.

   abstract = {The origin of the Greater Himalayan Sequence in the Himalaya and the paleogeographic position of the Lhasa terrane within Gondwanaland remain controversial. In the Eastern Himalayan syntaxis, the basement complexes of the northeastern Indian plate (Namche Barwa Complex) and the South Lhasa terrane (Nyingchi Complex) can be studied to explore these issues. Detrital zircons from the metasedimentary rocks in the Namche Barwa Complex and Nyingchi Complex yield similar U-Pb age spectra, with major age populations of 1.00-1.20 Ga, 1.30-1.45 Ga, 1.50-1.65 Ga and 1.70-1.80 Ga. The maximum depositional ages for their sedimentary protoliths are similar to 1.0 Ga based on the mean ages of the youngest three detrital zircons. Their minimum depositional ages are similar to 477 Ma for the Namche Barwa Complex and similar to 499 Ma for the Nyingchi Complex. Detrital zircons from the Namche Barwa Complex and Nyingchi Complex also display similar trace-element signatures and Hf isotopic composition, indicating that they were derived from common provenance. The trace-element signatures of 1.30-1.45 Ga detrital zircons indicate that the 1.3-1.5 Ga alkalic and mafic rocks belt in the southeastern India is a potential provenance. Most 1.50-1.65 Ga zircons have positive epsilon(Hf)(t) values (+1.2 to +9.0), and most 1.70-1.80 Ga zircons have negative eHf(t) values (-7.1 to -1.9), which are compatible with those of the Paleo- to Mesoproterozoic orthogneisses in the Namche Barwa Complex. Provenance analysis indicates that the southern Indian Shield, South Lhasa terrane and probably Eastern Antarctica were the potential detrital sources. Combined with previous studies, our results suggest that: (1) the Namche Barwa Complex is the northeastern extension of the Greater Himalaya Sequence; (2) the metasedimentary rocks in the Namche Barwa Complex represent distal deposits of the northern Indianmargin relative to the Lesser Himalaya; (3) the South Lhasa terrane was tectonically linked to northern India before the Cambrian.

   abstract = {U-Pb detrital zircon data from the Jurassic strata in the western Ordos Basin (WOB) show significant age differences between formations, from lower to upper including the Yan'an, Zhiluo, Anding, and Fenfanghe formations. The main peaks in the detrital zircon age spectra of the Yan'an Formation are at ca. 245, 444, 1813, and 2,387Ma, which resemble those of the underlying Triassic strata in the WOB. Combined with the occurrence of reworked sporopollen and carbonate debris, the sediments of the Yan'an Formation are interpreted to be potentially recycled from the residual Triassic highlands. The overlying Zhiluo Formation contains detrital zircons mostly in the 260-290Ma age range with only one peak at 269Ma, reflecting primary derivations from the Permian granites in the Yinshan Belt to the north and/or the Alxa Block to the northwest. The detrital zircon age compositions of the Anding Formation, however, are most varied, with one prominent age peak at 274Ma and several other minor peaks at 348Ma, 447, 932, 1641, 2143, and 2514Ma, reflecting complex origins. The uppermost syntectonic Fenfanghe Formation, contains detrital zircons with similar age compositions with the Yan'an Formation, once again interpreted as the result of recycled sedimentation. These two phases of multicycle sedimentation in the WOB reveals two intense tectonic events in the Late Triassic and Late Jurassic, whereas the provenance transition between the Yan'an and Zhiluo formations implies a less intense but extensive event in the Middle Jurassic. The complex age composition of the Anding Formation, however, are possibly as the result of climate change corresponding to the change of petrology and sediment colour. These Early-Middle Mesozoic tectonic events evidenced by the U-Pb ages record the tectonic transition of the North China Block from the Tethys to the paleo-Pacific tectonic domains.},

Detrital zircons from the Canggasaba and Lianxiang sections are dominated by Precambrian grains with subordinate numbers of Mesozoic grains clustering at 243-178, 164-117, and 109-91 Ma, consistent with the melange and trench-fill Rongmawa Formation, and all the trace elements of the Mesozoic grains match continental arc affinity. Provenance analysis suggests that detritus in these sections was mainly derived from the eastern part of the Gangdese arc and the central-northern Lhasa terrane. These results confirm the existence of the ancestral Lhasa River that transports sediments from the eastern Lhasa terrane to the subduction zone and further westward along the east-west axial system parallel to the trench. Conversely, the Qiajiu section is mainly dominated by Mesozoic detrital zircon grains, representing submarine fan deposits that were sourced from the adjacent Gangdese arc and transported through a local north-south-flowing river system. Detrital Cr-spinel compositions and detrital zircon trace elements from the Qiajiu section also revealed the contribution of ophiolites. Considering the abundance of Eurasia-affinity detrital zircons, this study supports the single subduction model that was developed along the southern margin of the Lhasa terrane.

   abstract = {The Mohe-Upper Amur Basin to the south of the eastern Mongol-Okhotsk Suture Zone contains important stratigraphic records for understanding the closure of the eastern Mongol-Okhotsk Ocean. The basin is crossed by the Russia/China border, and its Chinese and Russian parts are known as the Mohe Basin and Upper Amur Basin, respectively. Using most up-to-date data on stratigraphy, sedimentology, petrography, and detrital zircon U-Pb geochronology, this study establishes the stratigraphic correlation between the two, Mohe and Upper Amur parts of the basin, and analyzes depositional ages, provenance, and paleogeography of their Jurassic-Lower Cretaceous strata. The adopted Middle-Late Jurassic ages for the Xiufeng, Ershierzhan, Emuerhe, and Kaikukang formations in the Mohe Basin, are revised and constrained to late Kimmeridgian, Tithonian, Berriasian-early Valanginian, and late Valanginian ages, respectively. During the late Kimmeridgian-Tithonian, extension occurred in the Mohe-Upper Amur Basin, and sediments were mainly sourced from areas to the south of the basin. Later, in the Berriasian early Valanginian, the northern margin of the Mohe-Upper Amur Basin was uplifted and started furnishing sediments into the basin. In the late Valanginian, regional uplift of the northern part of the Mohe-Upper Amur Basin transformed the basin into a compressional intermountain basin, with sedimentation localized in its southern part. After the Valanginian, extension and associated volcanism occurred in the basin. We suggest that the evolution of the Mohe-Upper Amur Basin reflects the gradual closure of the eastern Mongol Okhotsk Ocean and associated collision of the Siberia Craton and the Amuria Block, that occurred from the Kimmeridgian Tithonian, to the west of the basin through to the Berriasian Valanginian, to the north and northeast of the basin. The final closure of the Mongol-Okhotsk Ocean to the north of the Mohe-Upper Amur Basin in the earliest Cretaceous significantly affected the sedimentological, structural and tectonic evolution of Northeast Asia.},

   abstract = {A significant transition in tectonic regime from extension to compression occurred throughout East Asia during the mid-Cretaceous and has stimulated much attention. However, the timing and driving mechanisms of the transition remain disputed. The Erlian Basin, a giant late Mesozoic intracontinental petroliferous basin located in the Inner Mongolia, Northeast China, contains important sedimentary and structural records related to the mid Cretaceous compressional event. The stratigraphical, sedimentological and structural analyses reveal that a NW-SE compressional inversion occurred in the Erlian Basin between the depositions of the Lower Cretaceous Saihan and Upper Cretaceous Erlian formations, causing intense folding of the Saihan Formation and underlying strata, and the northwestward migration of the depocenters of the Erlian Formation. Based on the newly obtained detrital zircon U-Pb data and previously published paleomagnetism-and fossil-based ages, the Saihan and Erlian formations are suggested as latest Aptian-Albian and post-early Cenomanian in age, respectively, implying that the inversion in the Erlian Basin occurred in the early Late Cretaceous (Cenomanian time). Apatite fission-track thermochronological data record an early Late Cretaceous cooling/exhuming event in the basin, corresponding well with the aforementioned sedimentary, structural and chronological analyses, Combining with the tectono-sedimentary evolutions of the neighboring basins of the Erlian Basin, we suggest that the early Late Cretaceous inversional event in the Erlian Basin and the large scale tectonic transition in East Asia shared the common driving mechanism, probably resulting from the Okhotomorsk Block-East Asia collisional event at about 100-89 Ma.},

   abstract = {The Erlian Basin is one of the largest intracontinental Meso-Cenozoic basins in Northeast China. The basin is filled with extra-thick Cretaceous sediments and offers unique opportunities to untangle the Late Mesozoic intraplate deformation in East Asia. However, despite decades of petroleum exploration in the basin, the Early Cretaceous chronostratigraphy and structural evolution of the Erlian Basin have been poorly studied. Based on newly obtained zircon U-Pb geochronological data, well lithological logs, and seismic reflection profiles, the present study carries out a detailed analysis of the tectonostratigraphic evolution of the Erlian Basin during the Early Cretaceous. The depositional ages of the Lower Cretaceous strata in the basin are refined, and the Early Cretaceous evolution of the basin is reestablished. The Lower Aershan, Upper Aershan, Lower Tenggeer, Upper Tenggeer, and Saihan formations are constrained to the middle Valanginian (ca. 138-135 Ma), late Valanginian (ca. 135-133 Ma), Hauterivian-early Aptian (ca. 133-121 Ma), middle Aptian (ca. 119-115 Ma), and latest Aptian-Albian (post ca. 115 Ma), respectively. The Early Cretaceous syn-rift subsidence of the basin was intermittent rather than continuous, and was punctuated by multiphase contractional deformation during the earliest Cretaceous (prior to ca. 138 Ma), middle Valanginian (ca. 135 Ma), latest Valanginian (ca. 133 Ma), middle Aptian (ca. 120 Ma), late Aptian (ca. 115 Ma), and Early/Late Cretaceous boundary. We tentatively attribute the extensional and contractional deformation in the Erlian Basin to a series of continental collisions along Asian margins: Karakoram-Lhasa/Qiangtang collision, Kolyma-Omolon/Siberia collision, Siberia/Amuria collision, Chukotka/Kolyma-Omolon collision, West Philippines/South China collision, and Okhotomorsk/East Asia collision.},

   abstract = {The Erlian Basin is an important part of the late Mesozoic extensional basin system in Northeast Asia. The basin contains thick Jurassic-Lower Cretaceous rocks and provides excellent opportunities to understand intracontinental deformation in Northeast Asia during the late Mesozoic. However, the Jurassic-Early Cretaceous evolution of the basin and associated driving mechanisms remain disputed. Based on 13 new zircon U-Pb ages for the Jurassic-lowest Cretaceous strata in the Erlian Basin, the correlation of Jurassic-lowest Cretaceous strata between the Erlian Basin and the Yan Shan is reestablished and a high-precision chronostratigraphic framework is presented. The Aqitu-Qiha formations are ascribed to the Aalenian-early Bathonian (ca. 174-167 Ma), the Xing'anling Group to the Oxfordian-early Kimmeridgian (ca. 163-153 Ma), the Hugejiletu Formation to the Tithonian-early Valanginian (ca. 151-139 Ma), and the Aershan Formation to the Valanginian-? (<= ca. 138 Ma). Combined with seismic reflection profiles, the Jurassic-earliest Cretaceous tectonostratigraphic evolution of the Erlian Basin is reconstructed and five major phases of deformation are revealed. These deformation phases include Aalenian-early Bathonian initial extension, late Bathonian-Callovian compression, Oxfordian-early Kimmeridgian extension, late Kimmeridgian-earliest Valanginian compression, and Valanginian extension. Integrated with geological evidences from peripheral regions of the Erlian Basin, potential driving mechanisms related to far-field tectonic events along Asian margins are suggested for each of these deformation phases.},

   abstract = {The ages and paleogeographic affinities of basement rocks of Tibetan terranes are poorly known. New U-Pb zircon geochronologic data from orthogneisses of the Amdo basement better resolve Neoproterozoic and Cambro-Ordovician magmatism in central Tibet. The Amdo basement is exposed within the Bangong suture zone between the Lhasa and Qiangtang terranes and is composed of granitic orthogneisses with subordinate paragneisses and metasedimentary rocks. The intermediate-felsic orthogneisses show a bimodal distribution of Neoproterozoic (920-820 Ma) and Cambro-Ordovician (540-460 Ma) crystallization ages. These and other sparse basement ages from Tibetan terranes suggest the plateau is underlain by juvenile crust that is Neoproterozoic or younger; its young age and weaker rheology relative to eratonic blocks bounding the plateau margins likely facilitated the propagation of lndo-Asian deformation far into Asia. The Neoproterozoic ages post-date Rodinia assembly and magmatism of similar ages is documented in the Qaidaim-Kunlun terrane, South China block, the Aravalli-Delhi craton in NW India, the Eastern Ghats of India, and the Prince Charles mountains in Antarctica. The Amdo Neoproterozoic plutons cannot be unambiguously related to one of these regions, but we propose that the Yangtze block of the South China block is the most likely association, with the Amdo basement representing a terrane that possibly rifted from the active Yangtze margin in the middle Neoproterozoic. Cambro-Ordovician granitoids are ubiquitous throughout Gondwana as a product of active margin tectonics following Gondwana assembly and indicate that the Lhasa-Qiangtang terranes were involved in these tectono-magmatic events. U-Pb detrital zircon analysis of two quartzites from the Amdo basement suggest that the protoliths were Carboniferous-Permian continental margin strata widely deposited across the Lhasa and Qiangtang terranes. The detrital zircon age spectra of the upper Paleozoic Tibetan sandstones and other rocks deposited in East Gondwana during the late Neoproterozoic and Paleozoic are all quite similar, making it difficult to use the age spectra for paleogeographic determinations. There is a suggestion in the data that the Qiangtang terrane may have been located further west along Gondwana's northern boundary than the Lhasa terrane, but more refined spatial and temporal data are needed to verify this configuration.

The detrital zircons from the Devonian and Carboniferous sandstones yielded similar age spectra in probability diagrams showing three distinct peaks at similar to 450 Ma, similar to 500 Ma and similar to 540 Ma, respectively, along with Proterozoic and Archean age groups, except for a relatively young age population at similar to 360 Ma detected for zircons from the Hongshuiquan Fm. The dating results suggest that the depositional time of the Niqiuhe Fm. should be younger than Late Silurian, as indicated by the youngest 422-Ma detrital zircon from this Fm., and that of the Hongshuiguan Fm. with a youngest detrital age of ca. 338 Ma, is younger than Middle Mississippian (Visean), which is in accordance with those inferred from biostratigraphic data. These dominant age groups are widely found in the Erguna and Xing'an blocks, it is suggested that the sediments of the studied sandstones from Niuqiuhe and Hongshuiquan Fms come mainly from the Erguna and Xing'an blocks. The epsilon(Hf) (t) value of dated zircons from our sandstones has a wide range (-21 to 16), which shows a mixed signature of that from Paleozoic granitoids in Xing'an block (6-17) and Erguna block (-2 to 6), indicating that Erguna and Xing'an blocks had connected before the Middle Devonian deposition of the Niqiuhe Fm. (422 +/- 5 Ma). Combined with the age data, we suggest that the Erguna and Xing'an blocks started to accrete at similar to 540 Ma, reached the peak of collision at similar to 500 Ma, and went into the post-collision stage from similar to 490 to similar to 450 Ma.

The study area is located between the Ondor Sum-Xar Moron and Hegenshan suture zones of the eastern segment of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt. Modal and geochemical analyses of Permian sandstones suggest derivation from dissected continental arc and recycled orogenic sources. LA-ICP-MS U-Pb detrital zircon data from sandstones indicate Early Permian to earliest Triassic maximum depositional ages (278 +/- 4 Ma to 249 +/- 3 Ma). These data also show two uniform age groups of 270-280 Ma and 310-320 Ma, and we interpret their source to be mainly the Sonidzuoqi-Xilinhot-southern Xi Ujimqin magmatic arc in the north (the southern margin of the Xing'an-Erguna block). The sample from the Upper Permian to lowermost Triassic Linxi Formation in the Linxi area also contains zircons with age groups of similar to 1800 Ma and similar to 2500 Ma, consistent with derivation from the northern margin of the North China craton, which lies to the south. Therefore, the collision between the North China craton and the Xing'an-Erguna block began during the deposition of the Linxi Formation, and the final closure of the intervening oceanic basin occurred during ca.

   abstract = {The Xilinhot Terrane is located in the eastern segment of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt in NE China, and is a key to a hotly debated issue on the Paleozoic tectonic evolution of this giant progenic belt. To constrain the tectonic evolution of the Xilinhot Terrane in the Late Paleozoic, we undertook zircon U-Pb dating and geochemical analyses of the Zhesi and Benbatu formations in the Suolun and Xi Ujimqin areas in the Xilinhot Terrane. Samples of the Benbatu Formation yield detrital zircon U-Pb ages ranging from 2659 Ma to 316 Ma, with four age populations at: 2659-1826 Ma, 1719-963 Ma, 590-402 Ma, and 396-316 Ma, whereas samples from the Zhesi Formation yield detrital zircon U-Pb ages ranging from 1967 Ma to 250 Ma, with four age populations at: 1967-1278 Ma, 971-693 Ma, 561-403 Ma, and 399250 Ma. The age groups of both the Benbatu and Zhesi formations in the Xilinhot Terrane are similar to those in other parts of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB). This evidence indicates that the Xilinhot Terrane is a microcontinent, and not an accretionary complex as previously thought. Furthermore, the youngest zircon grains in the Benbatu and Zhesi formations yield weighted mean (206)pb/U-238 ages of 322 +/- 12 Ma (MSDW = 0.12, n = 4) and 257 +/- 2.8 Ma (MSDW = 1.6, n = 8), respectively. Combined with fossil data, our new data suggest that the Benbatu and Zhesi formations in the Xilinhot Terrane were possibly deposited at similar to 322 Ma and similar to 257 Ma, respectively. Based on the provenance of the Carboniferous-Permian sandstones came from the blocks of NE China, we speculate that the Xilinhot Terrane is the western part of the Songliao block.

   abstract = {The Linxi Formation occupies an extensive area in the eastern Inner Mongolia in the Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB). The Linxi Formation is composed of slate, siltstone, sandstone and plant, lamellibranch microfossils in the associated strata. Major and trace element data (including REE) for sandstones from the formation indicate that these rocks have a greywacke protolith and have been deposited during a strong tectonic activity. LA-ICPMS U-Pb dating of detrital zircons yield ages of 1801 to 238 Ma for four samples from the Linxi Formation. 425-585 Ma, together with the similar to 500 Ma age for the metamorphism event previously determined for Northeast China, indicates that their provenance is the metamorphic rocks of Pan-African age that have a tectonic affinity to NE China. A few older zircons with U-Pb ages at 1689-1801 Ma, 1307-1414 Ma, 593-978 Ma are also present, revealing the Neoproterozoic history of NE China. The youngest population shows a peak at ca. 252 Ma, suggesting that the main deposition of the Linxi Formation was at late Permain. Moreover, the ca. 250 Ma zircon grains of all four samples yield weighted mean Pb-206/U-238 ages of 250 +/- 3 Ma, 248 +/- 3 Ma, 249 +/- 3 Ma, and 250 +/- 2 Ma, respectively. These ages, together with the youngest zircon age in the sample ZJB-28 (ca. 238 Ma), suggest that the deposition of the Linxi Formation extended to the early Triassic. Combining with previous results, we suggest that the final collision of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB) in the southern of Linxi Formation, which located in the Solonker-Xra-Moron Changchun suture, and the timing for final collision should be at early Triassic.

However, the dominant stage of formation of this Archean terrane remains unclear. In this paper, U-Pb and Lu-Hf isotopes of detrital zircons from two rivers and one stream in the northern part of the Kongling Terrane were studied by LA-ICP-MS and LA-MC-ICP-MS, respectively. These zircons show complicated internal structures in cathodoluminescence images, but the majority of them have linear or oscillatory zoning patterns, indicating magmatic origins. In general, the detrital zircons from these three local rivers show similar U-Pb age distributions. Together, they yield age peaks at 3.3-3.1 Ga (5%), 3.0-2.8 Ga (18%), 2.7-2.6 Ga (30%), 2.6-2.2 Ga (15%), 2.0-1.9 Ga (27%), 1.9-1.7 Ga (1%), 1.7-1.5 Ga (2%), and 1.0-0.8 Ga (1%). This age distribution implies that the North Kongling Terrane formed primarily during the Meso-to Neoarchean (3.0-2.6 Ga). Lu-Hf isotopic data reveal predominant subchondritic to chondritic epsilon(Hf)(t) values (-11.3 to 0) for the Mesoarchean zircons, indicating the dominant role of crustal reworking during this period. In comparison, most Neoarchean zircons exhibit near chondritic to suprachondritic epsilon(Hf)(t) values (up to + 7.4), suggesting juvenile crustal additions. The 2.0-1.9 Ga zircons have similar initial Hf isotopic compositions as those of the 2.7-2.6 Ga zircons, suggesting a metamorphic recrystallization origin. This observation further implies that the proportion of Neoarchean ages might be underestimated. Previous studies have reported several 2.7-2.6 Ga Archean outcrops, minor detrital zircons in Precambrian sedimentary rocks and xenocrystal zircons in volcanic rocks from the Yangtze craton. Combined with our data, we propose that the 2.7-2.6 Ga magmatism may have played an important role in forming the Kongling Terrane and have widely affected other parts of the Yangtze craton as well, similar to many other Archean cratons worldwide. The similar to 2.7-2.6 Gamay correspond to the initial stabilization of the Archean nucleus of the Yangtze craton. Thereafter, this craton shows comparable 2.5-2.2 Ga age records to the recently proposed Nunavutia supercraton, which could provide further clues to the early tectonic process of the Yangtze craton.

   abstract = {Sensitive High-Resolution Ion Microprobe (SHRIMP) U-Th-Pb isotopic data of detrital zircons from mature, quartz-rich meta-sandstones are used to constrain possible tectonic affinities and source regions of the rhythmically layered and graded-bedded series in the Yeoncheon Complex (Imjingang Belt) and the correlative Taean Formation. These metamorphic marine turbidite sequences presently occur along the Paleoproterozoic (1.93-1.83 Ga) Gyeonggi Massif, central Korea's main high-grade metamorphic gneiss terrane. Yet, detrital zircons yielded highly similar multimodal age spectra with peaks that do not match the age repartition in these basement rocks, as late (1.9-1.8 Ga) and earliest (similar to 2.5 Ga) Paleoproterozoic detrital modes are subordinate but, in contrast, Paleozoic (440-425 Ma) and Neoproterozoic (980-920 Ma) spikes are prominent, yet the basement essentially lacks lithologies with such ages. The youngest concordant zircon ages in each sample are: 378, 394 and 423 Ma. The maturity of the meta-sandstones and the general roundness of zircons of magmatic signature, irrespective of their age, suggest that sediments underwent considerable transport from source to sink, and possibly important weathering and recycling, which may have filtered out irradiation-weakened metamorphic zircon grains. In combination with these isotopic data, presence of a low-angle ductile fault contact between the Yeoncheon Complex and the Taean Formation and the underlying mylonitized Precambrian basement implies that they are in tectonic contact and do not have a stratigraphic relationship, as often assumed. Consequently, in all likelihood, both meta-sedimentary formations: (1) are at least of early Late Devonian age, (2) received much of their detritus from distant (reworked) Silurian-Devonian and Early Neoproterozoic magmatic sources, not present in the Gyeonggi Massif, (3) and not from Paleoproterozoic crystalline rocks of this massif, or other Korean Precambrian basement terranes, and (4) should be viewed as independent tectonic units that had sources not exposed in Korea. A thorough literature review reveals that the Yeoncheon Complex and the Taean Formation were potentially sourced from the Liuling, Nanwan and Foziling groups in the Qinling-Dabie Belt, which all show very similar detrital zircon age spectra. These immature middle-late Devonian sandstones were deposited in a pro-foreland basin formed as a result of the aborted subduction of the South Qinling Terrane below the North Qinling Terrane, which was uplifted and eroded during post-collision isostatic rebound. The submarine fans where the mature distal turbiditic Yeoncheon and Taean sandstones were deposited may have constituted the eastern terminal part of a routing system originating in the uplifted and eroded middle Paleozoic Qinling Belt and adjacent part of the foreland basin.},

   abstract = {The Heilongjiang Complex is a sequence of high-pressure (HP) metamorphic rocks that are distributed along the N-S suture zone between the Jiamusi and Songliao blocks in NE China. In this study, we investigated samples from Luobei in order to understand the geochronological and tectonic framework of the Heilongjiang Complex. The Heilongjiang Complex consists of two-mica schist, muscovite-albite schist, quartz schist, plagioclase gneiss, granitic gneiss, serpentinite, blueschist, greenschist, amphibolite, and marble. LA-ICP-MS dating of all samples shows a range of protolith ages from 435 to 210 Ma. These data, together with a 492 +/- 6 Ma age from a granite gneiss sample in the Yilan area, indicate that the protoliths of the Heilongjiang Complex were formed over a protracted time span from ~490 to ~210 Ma. In addition, five zircon grains in two samples contain metamorphic rims that yield ages of 197 +/- 2 Ma. These results, when combined with field evidence that the Heilongjiang Complex is overlain by Middle Jurassic strata, indicate it was metamorphosed between ~210 and 197 Ma and not in the Cretaceous as previously considered. This line of evidence, plus the occurrence of late Palaeozoic arc-affinity volcanic rocks in the eastern margin of the Jiamusi Block and syn-collisional Mesozoic volcanic rocks in the Zhangguangcai and Lesser Xing'an ranges, suggests the Heilongjiang Complex was a result of Panthalassa subduction during the late Palaeozoic and Paleo-Pacific subduction during the Mesozoic.},

   abstract = {Reconstruction of Cretaceous geological evolution of Tibetan Plateau growth is critical for assessing the effect of India-Asia collision on the formation of its high elevation. However, Cretaceous topographic evolution and geodynamic mechanism in northern Lhasa remain ambiguous. Here we present results from sedimentology, zircon U-Pb ages, and detrital Cr-spinel composition of the Tangza Formation in the western part of northern Lhasa. Sedimentary lithofacies document that orbitolinid foraminifera-limestone beds were deposited in a shallow-marine setting, while clastic rocks accumulated in an alluvial fan during the middle Cretaceous. Zircon U-Pb ages of interbedded volcanic rocks place a robust constraint on the initiation of clastic rock deposition at ca. 106 Ma. Sandstones are enriched lithic fragments with abundant volcanic grains. U-Pb ages of detrital zircon display a prominent age population at 101-130 Ma with a 120 Ma peak. These data indicate that the clastic rocks were mainly derived from northern Lhasa, including an Early Cretaceous magmatic arc. Sedimentary and provenance characteristics are most consistent with deposition in a local foreland basin. The activation of south-vergent local thrusting may be responsible for loading of the Tangza foreland basin. This thrust faulting may be associated with crustal shortening induced by the continuous convergence of Lhasa and Qiangtang since collision initiated during the Early Cretaceous. The initial uplift of western and central parts of northern Lhasa and eastern Gangdese arc occurred at ca. 106 Ma, while the widespread uplift of northern and central Lhasa probably initiated at ca. 92 Ma. The mid-Late Cretaceous uplift in Lhasa was significantly earlier than the early Cenozoic India-Asia collision.},

   abstract = {This paper reports U-Pb ages of detrital zircons from a series of clastic and pyroclastic rocks from the Murui Formation in the southern Great Xing'an Range (GXR), NE China, with the aim of constraining the depositional age of this poorly dated unit. These data, combined with the petrographic and sedimentology characteristics of the rocks, are used to constrain the sediment sources and tectonic setting of the provenance and provide wider insight into the tectonic evolution of the southern GXR during the Late Mesozoic. Two lithic arkose samples have dominant age groups at 249-250, 159-160, 136-147, and 394-415 Ma, and 301-323, 278-288, 209-237, and 142-163 Ma, respectively. The U-Pb zircon data constrain the maximum depositional age of the Murui Formation to 136 +/- 1 Ma, that is, the Early Cretaceous. A lithic-crystal tuff from the upper Murui Formation yielded zircons with a weighted mean U-Pb age of 136 +/- 1 Ma (n = 47, mean square weighted deviation (MSWD) = 2.2), indicating that volcanic activity was contemporaneous with sedimentation of the Murui Formation. U-Pb dating of zircons from a pyromeride in the Baiyingaolao Formation that was erupted unconformably onto the Murui Formation yielded a peak age of similar to 120 Ma, which constrains the depositional age of the Murui Formation to 120-136 Ma. Further dating of detrital zircons shows a range of ages, indicating the various of sediment origins. The Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous volcanic rocks in the GXR served as the principal detrital sources for the Murui Formation in the southern GXR. Grain size and modal analysis of the sediments shows that the depositional environment was a stable intracontinental fluvial setting, and the provenance of the detritus was most likely a magmatic arc. According to stratigraphic contact relations, the Baiyingaolao Formation is supposed to have obvious intervals with lower volcanic strata, which combined with disparities between the southern and northern GXR in terms of the duration of volcanism, magmatic events, and the depositional age of the Murui Formation. We can conclude that the restricted occurrence of the Early Cretaceous detritus between the earlier and later phases of volcanism suggests progressive exhumation of the southern GXR in the Early Cretaceous. These may relate to post-orogenic extension related to oceanic subduction. The southern GXR remained a site of active sedimentation during the continental extension period across the whole of NE China in the Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous.},

   abstract = {The provenance of late Paleozoic siliciclastic sedimentary strata on the northern margin of the Tarim Craton and the South Tianshan Orogenic Belt provides important insights into subduction and collision processes during the formation of the southern Central Asian Orogenic Belt. Detrital zircons from Carboniferous and Permian sedimentary rocks in the South Tianshan belt show two predominant age populations of 500-400 and 305-270 Ma, and three subordinate clusters around similar to 2.5 Ga, 2.0-1.7 Ga, and 1.2-0.6 Ma. Such age patterns are similar to major magmatic episodes in the Tarim Craton but are distinct from those in the Central Tianshan-Yili Block, implying that the Carboniferous-Permian strata in the South Tianshan belt were deposited on the northern margin of the Tarim Craton. These data, in combination with Carboniferous passive margin deposition along the South Tianshan and northern Tarim regions and intense arc magmatism in the Central Tianshan area, support the northward subduction of the South Tianshan oceanic crust. The abrupt decrease of zircon epsilon(Hf)(t) values at similar to 310 Ma indicates the tectonic transformation from oceanic subduction to continental collision. However, syn- and post-collisional sediments in the South Tianshan and northern Tarim regions did not contain detritus from the Central Tianshan-Yili Block, as evidenced by the absence/paucity of 380-310 Ma detrital zircons in the late Paleozoic strata and by the stratigraphic record in the regions. Insignificant surface erosion and uplifting during the collision and (ultra-)high-pressure rock exhumation require divergence in the frontal wedge. We propose that the switch from a convergent to a divergent regime was triggered by the arrival of the Tarim mantle plume in the latest Carboniferous, which possibly had profound effects on regional sedimentation and exhumation of (ultra-)high-pressure rocks in the orogenic belt.

   abstract = {Evidence for the Jurassic-Cretaceous Yanshan Movement (Orogeny) was first identified in the Jingxi Basin, a part of the Yanshan fold-and-thrust belt (YFTB) along the northern margin of the North China Craton. The disconformity or angular unconformity within the Jurassic volcano-sedimentary successions in the basin was interpreted to have resulted from a period of incipient shortening during the Yanshan Movement, commonly known as event A. However, the absolute ages of both event A and associated Jurassic units remain controversial. Here, we present the results of zircon U-Pb geochronology for volcanic and clastic rocks from the Jurassic units in the Jingxi Basin. The results provide better constraints on the depositional ages of formations in the basin: (1) Early-to-early Middle Jurassic (175-167 Ma) for the Nandaling Formation; (2) middle Middle Jurassic for the Yaopo Formation; (3) late Middle Jurassic for the Longmen Formation; (4) early Late Jurassic for the Jiulongshan Formation; and (5) late Late Jurassic (157-149 Ma) for the Tiaojishan Formation. Stratigraphic and geochronological correlations indicate that the Jiulongshan Formation and the Tiaojishan Formation are of different depositional ages in different regions. The Longmen Formation in the Jingxi Basin is equivalent to the Haifanggou Formation in the eastern YFTB. Two sedimentary cycles separated by a sedimentary hiatus, shown as disconformity and local angular unconformity, have been identified in the Jurassic sequences of the YFTB. Depositional ages of the rocks above and below the disconformity, which lies between the Yaopo and Longmen formations in the Jingxi Basin, constrain the timing of event A to 167 +/- 2 Ma (late Middle Jurassic). This event is the first phase of shortening deformation in eastern China induced by the paleo-Pacific plate subduction. We propose that the shortening period was relatively transient, in contrast to previous suggestions of long-duration shortening.},

Those rocks formed in a forearc region of a Permian island arc associated with subduction of the Panthalassa oceanic crust along the eastern margin of the South China block (Yangtze block). The provenance of the shallow-marine sediments was dominated by basaltic to andesitic volcanic rocks and minor granitic rocks during the late Middle to Late Permian.

The provenance, source rock compositions, and zircon age distribution for the forearc sediments, ACs and Meta-ACs have allowed us to reconstruct the geological history of the Permian arc system of the Kurosegawa belt. During the Middle Permian, the ACs were accreted along the eastern margin of the South China block. The Middle Permian arc was an immature oceanic island arc consisting of andesitic volcanic rocks. During the Late Permian, the ACs formed in a mature arc, producing voluminous felsic to andesitic volcanic rocks. A forearc basin developed during the late Middle to Late Permian. Subsequently, the Middle Permian ACs and part of the Late Permian AC underwent low-grade metamorphism in the Late to Early Jurassic, presenting the Meta-ACs.},

   abstract = {Provenance analysis and U-Pb dating of detrital zircons in Permian-Triassic forearc sediments from the Sulchothai Arc in northern Thailand clarify the evolution of a missing arc system associated with Paleo-Tethys subduction. The turbidite-dominant formations within the forearc sediments include the Permian Ngao Group (Kiu Lom, Pha Huat, and Huai Thak formations), the Early to earliest Late Triassic Lampang Group (Phra That and Hong Hoi formations), and the Late Triassic Song Group (Pha Daeng and Wang Chin formations). The sandstones are quartzose in the Pha Huat, Huai Thak, and Wang Chin formations, and lithic wacke in the Kiu Lom, Phra That, Hong Hoi and Pha Daeng formations. The quartzose sandstones contain abundant quartz, felsic volcanic and plutonic fragments, whereas the lithic sandstones contain mainly basaltic to felsic volcanic fragments. The youngest single-grain (YSG) zircon U-Pb age generally approximates the depositional age in the study area, but in the case of the limestone-dominant Pha Huat Formation the YSG age is clearly older. On the other hand, the youngest cluster U-Pb age (YC1 sigma) represents the peak of igneous activity in the source area. Geological evidence, geochemical signatures, and the YC1 sigma ages of the sandstones have allowed us to reconstruct the Sukhothai arc evolution. The initial Sukhothai Arc (Late Carboniferous Early Permian) developed as a continental island arc. Subsequently, there was general magmatic quiescence with minor I-type granitic activity during the Middle to early Late Permian. In the latest Permian to early Late Triassic, the Sukhothai Arc developed in tandem with Early to Middle Triassic I-type granitic activity, Middle to Late Triassic volcanism, evolution of an accretionary complex, and an abundant supply of sediments from the volcanic rocks to the trench through a forearc basin. Subsequently, the Sukhothai Arc became quiescent as the Paleo-Tethys closed after the Late Triassic. In addition, parts of sediments of supposed Devonian Carboniferous age within the Sukhothai Arc were revised as the Triassic Lampang Group, and the Early Cretaceous Khorat Group.},

Periods of low igneous activity are recorded by youngest single grain zircon U-Pb ages (YSG) that approximate or are older than the depositional ages obtained from radiolarian fossil-bearing mudstone. Periods of intensive igneous activity recorded by youngest cluster U-Pb ages (YC1 sigma) that correspond to the younger limits of radiolarian ages. The YC1 sigma U-Pb ages obtained from sandstones within melange units provide more accurate younger depositional ages than radiolarian ages derived from mudstone. Determining true depositional ages requires a combination of fossil data, detrital zircon ages, and provenance information. Fission-track ages using zircons estimated YC1 sigma U-Pb ages are useful for assessing depositional and annealing ages for the low-grade metamorphosed accretionary complex. These new dating presented here indicates the following tectonic history of the accretionary wedge. Evolution of the Shimanto accretionary complex from the Albian to the Turonian was caused by the subduction of the Izanagi plate, a process that supplied sediments via the erosion of Permian and Triassic to Early Jurassic granitic rocks and the eruption of minor amounts of Early Cretaceous intermediate volcanic rocks. The complex subsequently underwent intensive igneous activity from the Coniacian to the early Paleocene as a result of the subduction of a hot and young oceanic slab, such as the Kula-Pacific plate. Finally, the major out-of-sequence thrusts of the Fukase Fault and the Aki Tectonic Line formed after the middle Eocene, and this reactivation of the Shimanto accretionary complex as a result of the subduction of the Pacific plate.},

In sedimentary rocks of the Indochina Block, almost all of the Palaeozoic and Triassic zircons were sourced from the collision zone between the Indochina and South China blocks, and an active continental margin in the western Indochina Block. Sediments of the Sibumasu Block were supplied by erosion of Archaean basement and from the Grenville and the Pan African orogenies, but show no record of Permian to Triassic igneous activity. Accretionary complex sediments have provenances of both the Sukhothai Arc and the Indochina and South China blocks, with detrital zircons of various ages being supplied from crustal uplift and erosion related to the Indosinian I orogeny. Sedimentary rocks of the Nan Back-arc Basin are widely distributed not only in the Nan-Uttaradit but also in northern Sukhothai areas. The origin of the Pha Som Metamorphic Complex and associated formations can be traced to basin-filling sediments in the Nan Back-arc Basin. These detrital zircon U-Pb ages have also allowed identification of the changing tectonic setting in the Palaeo-Tethys convergence zone from the 'erosion of Proterozoic continental basement' to 'Palaeozoic active continental margin in the western Indochina Block' and 'Palaeozoic, Permian to Triassic collision zone between the South China and Indochina blocks' through to 'Triassic active Sukhothai Arc'.},

   abstract = {The modern Pearl River originates from SE Tibet and debouches into the South China Sea. The development of the Pearl River is closely related to the evolving topography following the tectonic evolution of the southern China continental margin and uplift of Tibet caused by the India-Eurasia collision. How topographic changes affected the development of the Pearl River, however, is still unclear. Here we use original and literature data on detrital zircon ages from both modem Pearl River sands and ancient strata drilled in offshore basins to reconstruct the evolution of the paleo-Pearl River catchment through time. Six phases are identified: 1) Early Cretaceous: the paleo-Pacific plate was subducting beneath the South China block and topography in South China was tilted to the west. The paleo-Dong River began to develop with limited length. 2) Late Cretaceous: back-arc extension in the South China Sea contributed further to the west-tilted topography. The paleo-Bei River started to develop and the paleo-Dong River continued to expand across southeasternmost China. 3) Paleocene to Eocene: active rifting in the South China Sea induced a major topographic change. The paleo-Dong and paleo-Bei joined, forming the paleo-Lower Xi River. 4) Early Oligocene: active uplift of Tibet and onset of sea-floor spreading in the South China Sea led to subsidence in the Cathaysia block. The paleo-Dong, paleo-Bei, and paleo-Lower Xi rivers remained limited to eastern Cathaysia. 5) Late Oligocene: accelerated uplift of eastern Tibet and post-rift subsidence of the northern South China Sea margin induced a radical change in the landscape of southern China, and transition from west-tilting to east-tilting topography. The paleo-Pearl River started to incorporate also its present western branches. 6) Early to middle Miocene: the east-tilting topography was enhanced during rapid uplift of Tibet and progressive closure of the proto-South China Sea, while the Pearl River evolved to its present configuration.},

   abstract = {The Neoproterozoic Kuruktag Group in the Kuruktag area located in the northeastern Tarim Craton, NW China, contains multiple diamictites in the Bayisi, Altungol, Tereeken and Hankalchough formations. In order to constrain their deposition age and reveal the crustal evolution history of the Tarim Craton, we integrated zircon LA-ICP-MS U-Pb ages and Hf-isotope data from volcanic and sedimentary samples in the Kuruktag Group. Two volcanic rocks in the upper Altungol Formation yield ages of 655.9 +/- 4.4 Ma and 654 +/- 10 Ma, respectively, first constraining the termination of the Altungol diamictite and the beginning of the Tereeken diamictite. A tuffaceous bed in the uppermost Zhamoketi Formation between the Hankalchough and Tereeken diamictites gives a 616.5 +/- 15.9 Ma age, confirming a maximum age boundary for the youngest Hankalchough diamictite. Along with existing isotopic and geochemical data from other Neoproterozoic glaciations in the world, we propose an Ediacaran age for the Hankalchough diamictite, a Marinoan-age for the Tereeken diamictite and a Sturtian-age for the Altungol diamictite. 355 groups of U-Pb age data of detrital zircons from the Baysi and Altungol formations define three major age populations: Neoarchean to early Paleoproterozoic group (weak peaks between 2.8 and 2.3 Ga), Paleoproterozoic group (peak at 1898 Ma) and Neoproterozoic group (peak at 805 Ma). The oldest age population indicates the presence of Neoarchean to early Paleoproterozoic magmatism in the Tarim Craton. The age peak at 1898 Ma is consistent with the Paleoproterozoic high-grade metamorphism and anatexis event which should be correlated with the amalgamation of the Columbia supercontinent. The largest age cluster of 900-700 Ma is interpreted to represent the response of the Rodinia supercontinent. The Hf isotopic model age data of detrital zircons indicate five major stages of crustal growth at 3.6 Ga, 3.3 Ga, 3.1 Ga, 2.9 Ga and 2.7 Ga. The fact that most detrital zircons show negative sHf(t) values suggests that their provenances were dominated by reworked crustal materials. The remaining few detrital zircons exhibit positive Hf(t) values, implicating the addition of juvenile crustal materials. In addition, the magmatic zircons with ages of 655 Ma and 616 Ma in our volcanic samples display epsilon Hf(t) values from -7.60 to +4.33, suggesting that they have different magma sources. According to the parallel Precambrian age distribution and Neoproterozoic stratigraphy, we propose that the Tarim Craton had a close relationship with the Yangtze Craton in Rodinia (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

   abstract = {The origin and tectonic setting of Precambrian sequences in the Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB) have been debated due to a lack of high resolution geochronological data. Answering this question is essential for the understanding of the tectonic framework and Precambrian evolution of the blocks within the CAOB. Here we reported LA-ICP-MS detrital zircon U-Pb ages and in-situ Hf isotopic data for Neoproterozoic sedimentary cover in the northern Yili Block, an important component of the CAOB, in order to provide information on possible provenance and regional tectonic evolution. A total of 271 concordant U-Pb zircon ages from Neoproterozoic sedimentary cover in the northern Yili Block define three major age populations of 1900-1400 Ma, 1300-1150 Ma and 700-580 Ma, which are quite different from cratons and microcontinents involved in the CAOB. Although it is not completely consistent with the local basement ages, an autochthonous provenance interpretation is more suitable. Some zircon grains show significant old Hf model ages (T-DM(C); 3.9-2.4 Ga) and reveal continental crust as old as Paleoarchean probably existed. Continuous Mesoproterozoic zircon age populations exhibit large variations in the epsilon Hf(t) ratios, suggesting the long-time involvement of both reworked ancient crust and juvenile material. Similar Mesoproterozoic evolution pattern is identified in many continental terranes involved in the CAOB that surround the Tarim Craton. Based on our analysis and published research, we postulate that the northern Yili Block, together with Chinese Central Tianshan, Kyrgyz North Tianshan and some other microcontinents surrounding the Tarim Craton, once constituted the continental margin of the Tarim Craton in the Mesoproterozoic, formed by long-lived accretionary processes. Most of the late Neoproterozoic zircons exhibit significant positive epsilon Hf(t) ratios, suggesting the addition of juvenile crust. It is consistent with the tectonic event related to the East Africa Orogen in the Arabian-Nubian Shield and the northern Tarim Craton, indicating the affinity between them in Gondwana.

   abstract = {In situ U-Pb and Hf isotope analyses were made on detrital zircons isolated from sands of the Yangtze River in order to understand the evolution and history of crust in that river basin. A total of 2277 detrital zircon grains were dated by the LA-ICP-MS U-Pb technique and 674 grains were also analyzed for Hf isotopes on the same spots of concordant grains. Our results show five major groups of U-Pb ages: at 2.4-2.6 Ga, 1.8-2.0 Ga, 700-850 Ma, 400-550 Ma and 200-300 Ma, which correspond to known granitoid magmatic events within the drainage (Liliangian, Jinningian, Caledonian, Hercynian and Indo-Sinian/Yanshanian). The initial Hf isotope ratios [epsilon(Hf)(t)] of the zircons exhibit a wide range from negative to positive for each of the five major age groups, revealing that existing crustal materials were mixing with variable volumes of new mantle melt at these times. Zircon Hf model ages (T-DM2) display two major ranges of crustal growth, one being Mesoproterozoic (1.0-1.5 Ga) and the other Archean-Paleoproterozoic (2.5-2.8 Ga). These zircons were mainly sourced from the Yangtze Craton and the Cathaysia Block, respectively. Crustal growth rates based on TDM2 model ages suggest that 30% of the present crustal volume was formed by 2.5 Ga, 48% by 1.8 Ga, 70% by 1.4 Ga and 96% was formed by 1.0 Ga. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V.

This widespread unconformable surface is akin to the Great Unconformity seen elsewhere in the world and highlights a major shift in depositional style from largely erosional, marked by low rates of net deposition, during the mid- to late Neoproterozoic to high rates of transgressive deposition during the mid-to late Cambrian. The age spectra for the southeastern NCC and northern India are consistent with a provenance affinity linking the NCC and East Gondwana by c. 510 Ma.},

   abstract = {Ordovician sedimentary strata at the southeastern margin of the Yangtze Block consist of, from bottom to top, fine-grained siliciclastic rocks, cherts with interlayers of siliceous/carbonaceous slate, and coarse-grained siliciclastic rocks, which are important for understanding the tectono-sedimentary evolution in South China. A combined analysis of petrography, whole-rock geochemistry, and zircon U-Pb dating was carried out on these strata. The cherts with radiolarian fossils have high Al/(Al + Fe + Mn) values (0.38-0.94) and no obvious Ce anomalies (1.09 +/- 0.05), suggesting a biogenic origin on a continental margin. The geochemical features of the siliciclastic rocks, including ratios of elements, discriminant functions, and ternary diagram positions, suggest a passive margin setting that received detritus mostly derived from intermediate to felsic igneous rocks and recycled quartzose sedimentary rocks. The source areas of the Ordovician siliciclastic rocks existed in semiarid-arid paleoclimate and moderate weathering conditions. The sandstone modal grain compositions and detrital zircon cumulative curves indicate a collisional setting of the source areas. Zircon age populations have been time-varying during the Early Paleozoic. Based on the above-mentioned evidences, the following basin filling and paleotopographic evolution process has been proposed in research area. In the Cambrian, a bilateral filling pattern reflected a flat and broad basin. In the Early Ordovician, longer transportation of SE-sourced sediments reflected the uplift of Gondwana. In the Late Ordovician, uplift of the Wuyi-Yunkai Orogen blocked some Gondwanan detritus (500-700 Ma) and released recycled (900-1100 Ma) and syn-orogenic detritus. Meanwhile, synchronous uplift of the Jiangnan Orogen led to a steeper and narrower basin, and sediments could reach farther distances in a shorter time. In the Silurian, a unidirectional filling pattern with overwhelming SE-sourced detritus indicated intense uplift of Gondwana and the Wuyi-Yunkai Orogen.},

Remnants of upper Cenozoic fluvial to marginal marine proto-Mekong sediments are exposed in the Da Lat Zone in southeast Vietnam and are likely the on-land equivalents of large sediment packages offshore in the Cuu Long and Nam Con Son Basins. Provenance studies are used here to identify sources that allow reconstruction of sediment pathways. The Oligo-Miocene Di Linh Formation has a main Cretaceous zircon age population and subordinate Paleoproterozoic (c. 1.8-1.9 Ga) zircons, sourced mainly from Cretaceous plutons. In contrast, the early Pliocene to Pleistocene Song Luy Formation includes additional Permian-Triassic and Ordovician-Silurian age populations which are interpreted to be sourced from basement rocks in central and northern Vietnam. There is a significant change in provenance between these formations, interpreted as an intra-Miocene unconformity. The late Pliocene to Pleistocene Ba Mieu Formation shows a much greater abundance of Precambrian zircons, including a small age peak at c. 2.5 Ga, interpreted to be derived from old basement exposed in South China. Abundant Cretaceous zircons and a lack of Jurassic zircons in all three formations contrast with the present-day Mekong River delta. Therefore, the data are proposed to show a development of the proto-Mekong River progressing northward from the Da Lat Zone, to the Kontum Massif and northern Vietnam, to capturing of reversed rivers and/or reworking of sediments from old cratons in South China.},

Detrital zircon U-Pb geochronology results presented here are the first of their kind in southern Mongolia. Geologic mapping, stratigraphic interpretations, and provenance data including U-Pb zircon geochronology suggest that sedimentary strata at two localities in southern Mongolia, Bulgan Uul and Nomgon, were once part of the same closing ocean basin. The Upper Permian sedimentary deposits at Bulgan Uul record an upward-shallowing marine succession that is unconformably overlain by Lower Triassic fluvial and alluvial strata. The Bulgan Uul marine succession is composed of distal turbidite fan deposits in the lowest portion of the section, with interbedded sandstone and limestone interpreted as shallow-marine deposits at the top of the section. Exposures of Permian-aged distal turbidite units at Nomgon are similar in stratigraphic architecture, sandstone provenance, and detrital zircon age distributions to those documented at Bulgan Uul. Paleocurrent measurements, sandstone provenance data, and U-Pb ages from detrital zircons collected from both study locations document southeastern transport directions for sediment derived from extinct Carboniferous and Ordovician-Silurian arcs of the southern Altaids. Results are consistent with depositional models for remnant ocean basins and indicate diachronous west-to-east closure of the paleo-Asian Ocean (a northern segment of Paleotethys) in the Late Permian. Finally, basin reconstructions place the coeval turbidite deposits at Nomgon to the southeast of Bulgan Uul during the Late Permian. These correlative turbidite successions at Nomgon are currently northeast of Bulgan Uul, offset by similar to 250 km of left-lateral strike-slip faulting across the East Gobi fault zone.},

   abstract = {The location of the suture zone between the South China and Indochina blocks in northwest Vietnam has been under debate for decades. Generally, the boundary between these blocks has been placed along (1) the Ailaoshan-Red River zone or (2) the Song Ma zone. The Sin Quyen Formation, lying between these zones, was previously regarded as a Palaeo- and Mesoproterozoic sequence. It comprises its provenance and tectonic affinity. We analysed detrital zircons from two paragneisses and one migmatite of the Sin Quyen Formation employing laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry U-Pb dating techniques. U-Pb ages of these zircons show three main periods of zircon formation: similar to 2.7-3.0, similar to 2.2-2.5, and similar to 1.8 Ga, suggesting that Sin Quyen rocks were mainly derived from Palaeoproterozoic and Archaean basement units. Inasmuch as the South China basement comprises rocks of similar ages, we conclude that the Sin Quyen Formation belongs to that block. Our new data strengthen the view that the suture between the South China and Indochina blocks is located within the Song Ma zone. In addition, zircons with U-Pb ages >3.0 thousand million years represent the oldest minerals reported in northwest Vietnam so far, indicating the existence of Mesoarchaean crustal remnants in this region.},

   abstract = {The provenance of karstic bauxite deposits is difficult to constrain as such deposits are the products of intensively weathered rocks. We have studied the geochemistry of interbedded clastic rocks and isotopic characteristics of detrital zircons in late Permian karstic bauxite deposits in SW China to understand their provenance. The U-Pb ages of detrital zircons from both clastic rocks and bauxite ores show a peak at similar to 260 Ma. This peak age is within error of the sedimentary age (259.8 +/- 0.4 Ma) of the bauxite ores and the age of emplacement of the Emeishan large igneous province in SW China. The peak age, together with abundant fragments of volcanic quartz crystals in the clastic rocks, suggests that the bauxite deposit was derived from volcanic rocks. Further, the clastic rocks yield Al2O3/TiO2 values of 25-132 and delta Eu = 0.23-0.58, showing arc-like REE trends and indicating that the source rocks were felsic. The epsilon(Nd)(T) values of the bauxite ores and clastic rocks typically range from - 7.6 to - 3.5, with 130 out of 140 detrital zircons yielding epsilon(Hf)(T) values of -26.7 to -0.6 and delta O-18 values of +5.6% to +10.3%., consistent with a dominantly crustal provenance. Based on the paleogeography and distribution of Permian magmatic rocks in SW China, it is likely that the karstic bauxite deposits were derived from the felsic volcanic rocks of a Permian magmatic arc at the northern margin of the Paleo-Tethys, rather than from the Emeishan large igneous province. This study provides a new perspective on the provenance of karstic bauxite deposits worldwide and yields insights into element mobility during extreme weathering.

   abstract = {Whether any Grenvillian magmatic records are preserved in the North China Craton (NCC) is a key issue to understand the Proterozoic tectonic evolution of the NCC and its correlation to the supercontinent Rodinia. Meso- to Neo-proterozoic sedimentary series is well exposed in the NCC, but magmatic events in this period, especially of 1.3-1.0 Ga, have seldom been reported. New U-Pb isotopic dating and Hf isotopic composition analyses have been carried out in this study using SIMS and LA-ICP-MS methods on detrital zircons from sandstones of the Tumen Group in the Shandong Peninsula and quartz sandstones of the Sangwon System in the Phyongnam Basin, North Korea. The age populations of the detrital zircons of the Tumen Group are at similar to 2.5 Ga, similar to 1.85 Ga, similar to 1.7 Ga, similar to 1.58 Ga, similar to 1.5 Ga, similar to 1.36 Ga and similar to 1.2 Ga and those of the Sangwon System are at 1.88-1.86 Ga, similar to 1.78 Ga, 1.62-1.58 Ga, 1.46-1.41 Ga, similar to 1.32 Ga, similar to 1.17 Ga and similar to 980 Ma. Most of the age peaks of Neoarchean and Proterozoic correspond to the significant tectonic-magmatic-thermal events previously recognized in the NCC, revealing that the main provenances of the Tumen Group and the Sangwon System are Early Precambrian basement and Late Paleo- to Meso-proterozoic magmatic rocks of the NCC. Furthermore, the youngest detrital zircon ages of similar to 1.1 Ga from the Tumen Group and 984 Ma from the Sangwon System, as well as 910 Ma Rb-Sr whole rock isochron age of a limestone from the lumen Group and 899 Ma mafic sills intruding the Sangwon System suggest that both groups were deposited in the Neoproterozoic, coevally with the Qingbaikou System in the Yanliao Aulacogen. The common zircon ages of 1.3-1.0 Ga from the Tumen Group and the Sangwon System, as well as the contemporaneous Penglai and Yushulazi Group in the eastern margin of the NCC, indicate that during the deposition of these sediments there have been significant contributions from Grenvillian magmatic rocks in the eastern NCC. This may provide clues to understand the possible relationship of the NCC and the supercontinent Rodinia. Moreover, the positive epsilon Hf (t) and similar to 2.8 Ga crust model ages of detrital magmatic zircons of 2.8-2.4 Ga suggest that there have been significant crustal growth at similar to 2.8 Ga in the eastern margin of the NCC, same as in other areas of the NCC.

   abstract = {Late Paleoproterozoic rifting and accompanying magmatism and sedimentation, which occurred widely in the North China Craton, are interpreted to be related to the breakup of the supercontinent Columbia. The Ruyang Group, overlying the Xiong'er Group in the southern margin of the craton, is a typical fluvial-marine sedimentary sequence mainly composed of sandstone with minor shale and dolostone. Sandstones from the Ruyang Group exhibit high contents of SiO2 (86.8-98.7 wt.%) but relatively low contents of Al2O3, K2O, Na2O, TiO2 and MgO, typical of mature siliceous clastic rocks. Trace elements of these rocks indicate that the sequence was deposited in a passive continental margin environment and that the sedimentary detritus was derived from a Paleoproterozoic silicic-intermediate source, similar to other Paleo-Mesoproterozoic sedimentary sequences in the region. Detrital zircons from three sandstone samples of the Ruyang Group yield (207)pb/Pb-206 ages ranging from 1.70 Ga to 2.70 Ga with two pronounced peaks at ca. 2.10 Ga and 1.86 Ga. A weighted mean age at 1744 +/- 22 Ma from nine young zircon ages between 1.80 Ga and 1.70 Ga can constrain the maximum depositional age of the Ruyang Group. Most detrital zircons exhibit negative epsilon(Hf)(t) values ranging from -15.6 to 0 and old T-DM(C) ages ranging from 2.50 Ga to 3.60 Ga, implying reworking of Archean crust. A close match between the U-Pb ages and T-DM(C)(Hf) ages, as well as the positive epsilon(Hf)(t) values for some detrital zircons, indicate a contribution of juvenile materials. The detrital zircon grains have T-DM(C)(Hf) ages clustering between 3.00 Ga and 2.60 Ga with a peak at around 2.80-2.70 Ga, indicating a major period of crustal growth at this time.

   abstract = {The relationship between the Alxa block and the North China Craton (NCC) is one of the controversial tectonic issues in China. The age spectra of detrital zircons from sedimentary rocks may help resolve the tectonic affinity of the Alxa block. The Langshan terrane is located in the northeast margin of the Alxa block which is connected to the northwest margin of the NCC. Detailed U-Pb dating of zircon from the meta-volcanic rocks and meta-sedimentary rocks of the Precambrian Langshan group shows that the Langshan Group formed in the Neoproterozoic. The evidence includes the zircon age of 804.1 +/- 3.5 Ma for the meta-volcanic rocks and the youngest detrital zircon age peak at 1187-810 Ma for the meta-sedimentary rocks. The detrital zircon age patterns of the Langshan group and Precambrian strata of the Alxa block and the NCC are similar. The older and younger detrital zircon age peaks of the Langshan group are comparable to those of the NCC and the Alxa block, respectively. The 1.7-1.5 Ga detrital zircons in the Langshan Group, which might be derived from the "Zhaertai-Bayan Obo-Huade" Mesoproterozoic rift system in the northern margin of the NCC, are not found in the Precambrian strata of the Alxa block. The detrital zircon age peaks of the Langshan group are well correlated to the known Precambrian tectono-thermal events that affected both the Alxa block and the NCC. The development of the Langshan Neoproterozoic rift system is shown by the contemporaneous magmatism in the Alxa block and the adjacent NCC. The results from this study indicate that the Alxa block and the NCC were together in the Neoproterozoic. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {The large-scale Dahongliutan hematite-rich Fe deposit in the Tianshuihai terrane (Western Kunlun orogenic belt), Xinjiang, northwestern China, contains proven Fe ore reserves exceeding 100 Mt at an average grade of 35 wt.% Fe(t) (maximum 53 wt.%). The deposit is hosted in the Neoproterozoic Tianshuihai Group, a suite of neritic, siliciclastic and sedimentary carbonate rocks subjected to greenschist-facies metamorphism. The Fe orebodies are laminate, stratoid, lenticular and interlayered with marbles and schists. Ore minerals mainly contain hematite, with minor siderite and limonite and rare sulfides, whereas gangue minerals mainly comprise quartz, dolomite, ankerite, calcite, muscovite and chloritoid. Most Fe ores display lepidoblastic, blastopsammitic, crystalloblastic and metasomatic textures with massive or banded structures. Based on mineral assemblages, the Fe ores are divided into four types, namely: (1) Quartz-hematite; (2) Quartz-dolomite-calcite-muscovite-hematite; (3) Quartz-ankerite-hematite; (4) Quartz-siderite-hematite. Zircon U-Pb analyses on the marbles and schists yielded a Neoproterozoic age (Ediacaran; 593 +/- 7 Ma), whereas those on the ore-intruding medium-grained porphyritic biotite-quartz monzonite, medium to fine grained biotite-quartz monzonite and metagabbro yielded Cambrian-Early Ordovician ages (i.e., 484.5 +/- 2.7, 527.9 +/- 2.8 and 532.3 +/- 3.1 Ma), which altogether constrain the ore formation to the Late Neoproterozoic to Early Cambrian (532-593 Ma). In addition, the 163 detrital zircon analyses on the Dahongliutan marble and schist define five major age populations, namely: 2561-2329, 2076-1644, 1164-899, 869-722 and 696-593 Ma. Provenance studies show that the detritals at Dahongliutan were mainly sourced from the North Kunlun and Tianshuihai terranes. Comparison with typical BIF deposits in the world, we infer that the deposit belongs to Neoproterozoic (Ediacaran) BIF-related sedimentary metamorphic type iron deposit and resembles Superior-type BIF, probably reflecting the recurrence of anoxic ferruginous conditions in the Neoproterozoic-Early Cambrian deep sea.

Modal and detrital zircon data, along with published paleocurrent data, sedimentary facies, and euhedral to subhedral detrital zircon shapes, indicate derivation from multicomponent, nearby sources with input from both the interior of the craton to the northwest and from an inferred arc accretionary complex to the southeast. The detrital zircon U-Pb age spectra range in age from Archean to early Mesozoic, with major age groups at 2000-1700Ma, 1200-900Ma, 400-340Ma, and 300-240Ma. In addition, Early Jurassic strata include zircon detritus with ages of 200-170Ma. Regional geological relations suggest that Precambrian and Early Paleozoic detritus was derived from the inland Wuyi Mountain region and Yunkai Massif of the South China Craton. Sources for Middle Paleozoic to early Mesozoic detrital zircons include input from beyond the currently exposed China mainland. Paleogeographic reconstruction in East Asia suggests derivation from an active convergent plate margin along the southeastern rim of the craton that incorporated part of Southwest Japan and is related to the subduction of the Paleo-Pacific Ocean. Integration of the geologic and provenance records of the Yong'an Basin with the time equivalent Yongjiang and Shiwandashan basins that lie to the southwest and south, respectively, provides an integrated record of the subduction of the Paleo-Pacific Ocean along the southeast margin of the South China Craton and termination of subduction of the Paleo-Tethys beneath its southwest margin in Permo-Triassic.},

The provenance record of these successions, based on modal analysis, geochemical composition, detrital zircon U-Pb ages, and paleocurrent data indicate derivation from the adjoining Precambrian Yunkai massif and surrounding Paleozoic sedimentary units. The quartz dominated nature of the siliciclastic units, along with their high Th/Sc and Zr/Sc ratios indicate a recycled orogen source.

Late Triassic sandstones show a similar detrital zircon age pattern as well as a 300-250 Ma age group. Integration of this provenance data with regional geological information suggests that the unconformity at the base of the Permian succession is related to subduction of the Paleo-Tethys ocean to the south of the craton, whereas the major driver for Triassic tectonic activity corresponds with terrane accretion and the termination of Paleo-Tethys Ocean subduction along the southwest margin of the craton.

   abstract = {It was commonly accepted that the North Lhasa terrane of the present-day central Tibetan Plateau in Asia came from the northern Gondwana, but the timing of its northward drifting away from the Gondwana remains controversial. Here we present for the first time U-Pb age and Hf isotope data on detrital zircons from the Cambrian metasedimentary rocks in the North Lhasa terrane. The detrital zircons display age peaks at ca. 505, 548, 926, and 1104 Ma, and are interpreted to have Gondwanan source regions. These metasedimentary rocks were probably deposited in a collisional tectonic setting (e.g., foreland basin) related to the Cambrian collisional accretion of microcontinents along the Gondwanan proto-Tethyan margin. The Cambrian and Carboniferous-Late Triassic sedimentary rocks in, the North Lhasa terrane share the similar Precambrian-Cambrian detrital zircon age and epsilon(Hf)(t) distributions, indicating constant source accretion during the Cambrian-Triassic time. By contrast, the Precambrian-Cambrian detrital zircon age distribution of the Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous sedimentary rocks in the North Lhasa terrane is distinctive from that of the adjacent Cambrian-Triassic sedimentary rocks, suggesting that the northward drifting of this terrane occurred in the Jurassic.},

   abstract = {U-Pb dating and Hf isotopes of detrital zircons from the Nanhua System in Longsheng, northern Guangxi, were investigated to determine the depositional age and provenance of the Nanhua System and the early crustal evolution stages of the South China. U-Pb ages of detrital zircons from the Chang'an Formation of the Nanhua System in Longsheng, northern Guangxi, are mainly 0.66 similar to 0.72 Ga and 0.72 similar to 0.90 Ga, with epsilon(Hf)(t) ranging from -17.05 to 12.79. The dominant provenance is composed of Neoproterozoic magmatic rock from the southeastern margin of the Yangtze Block and the Nanhua period detrital material from Cathaysia Block. U-Pb ages of detrital zircons from the Fulu Formation can be divided into four major groups, that is, 0.64 similar to 0.72 Ga, 0.72 similar to 0.90 Ga, 1.80 similar to 2.20 Ga, and 2.30 similar to 2.80 Ga, with epsilon(Hf)(t) ranging from -27.66 to 11.68. The main provenance is Neoproterozoic magmatic rock from the southeastern margin of Yangtze Block, followed by the Nanhua period detrital material from the Cathaysia Block and geological body equivalent to the assembly of the Columbia Supercontinent. U-Pb age of detrital zircons from Lijiapo Formation is concentrated in 0.72 similar to 0.90 Ga, with (epsilon Hf)(t) ranging from -16.02 to 11.87, and the main provenance comes from Neoproterozoic magmatic rock in the south-east margin of Yangtze Block. The second-stage Hf model age (T-DM2) of the Nanhua System is 0.84 similar to 4.51 Ga, with two obvious peak intervals of 0.90 similar to 1.30 Ga and 1.40 similar to 2.10 Ga, and two secondary peak intervals of 2.40 similar to 3.00 Ga and 3.10 similar to 3.60 Ga, which can be interpreted that the research area has experienced four stages of crustal growth: 3.10 similar to 3.60 Ga, 2.40 similar to 3.00 Ga, 1.40 similar to 2.10 Ga, and 0.90 similar to 1.30 Ga. The detrital zircon age spectra indicate that the Chang'an Formation and Fulu Formation of the Nanhua System contain more detrital zircons which is contemporaneous with strata due to the Xuefeng orogeny, while the Lijiapo Formation contains a very small amount of detrital zircon which is contemporaneous with strata, suggesting that the tectonic setting has shifted to a passive continental margin or pull-apart basin during the period of the Lijiapo Formation.},

   abstract = {The age and composition of the basement rocks underlying the Mesozoic volcanic rocks in southeastern China have been long debated. New field investigation, stratigraphical and sedimentological studies of the Fuding inlier in eastern Cathaysian block have identified the presence of three stratigraphic units. The Upper Carboniferous carbonate unit, composed of silicified limestone, deposited on carbonate platform in a continental shelf environment. The Lower Permian siliciclastic unit, consisting of slate and phyllite with minor arenites, deposited on shallow semi-restricted shelf. The third unit is a suite of Jurassic conglomerates and sandstones deposited in alluvial fan environment. Provenance data indicate that the Fuding inlier was part of the Wuyishan terrane in the eastern Cathaysian block. The U-Pb age and Hf isotope of detrital zircons indicate that extensive magmatic activity happened during 280-360 Ma in the source area. The epsilon(Hf) values of detrital zircons point to magmatic mixing of juvenile material and Precambrian crust. The similarities in rock compositions and detrital zircon ages among the Yeongnam massif in the Korean Peninsula, the Tananao complex in Taiwan and the Fuding inlier have led to the conclusion that these three regions most likely belonged to the Wuyishan terrane, eastern Cathaysia during the late Paleozoic.

   abstract = {The Xigaze forearc basin provides information on subduction evolution and magmatic growth of the Gangdese arc as well as on the India-Asia continental collision. Recently obtained sedimentological, biostratigraphic, petrographic, geochemical and geochronological data on Cretaceous to Paleogene strata in the Cuojiangding area (Zhongba county, south Tibet) shed new light on the tectonic evolution of the southern margin of the Lhasa Block during closure of Neotethys and initial collision with India. The uppermost Cretaceous Padana and Qubeiya formations, deposited in deltaic to inner shelf environments, and representing the final filling of the Xigaze forearc basin, were unconformably overlain by the Quxia and Jialazi formations, deposited in fan-delta environments during the Paleocene/earliest Eocene. Petrographic data and U-Pb ages of detrital zircons document the progressive unroofing of the Gangdese arc, which remained the dominant source of detritus throughout the Late Cretaceous to Paleogene. Detrital Cr-spinets in the Quxia and Jialazi formations are geochemically similar to those in Cretaceous Xigaze forearc strata but different from those hosted in Yarlung Zangbo ophiolites, suggesting that the latter were not exposed to erosion in the considered time window. Sandstone petrography, Cr-spinel-geochemistry, U-Pb age spectra and Hf isotopic ratios of detrital zircons in the Quxia and Jialazi formations match those in Paleogene sediments deposited on the distal (Sangdanlin and Zheya formations) and proximal Indian margin (Enba and Zhaguo formations), suggesting that the Quxia and Jialazi formations documents syncollisional fan-deltas deposited on top of the nascent Himalayan orogenic belt. In this scenario, the onset of the India-Asia collision predates deposition of the Quxia and Jialazi formations and is thus constrained as younger than 66 Ma and older than 58 Ma.

   abstract = {The collision of India with Asia had a profound influence on Cenozoic topography, oceanography, climate, and faunal turnover. However, estimates of the time of the initial collision, when Indian continental crust arrived at the Transhimalayan trench, remain highly controversial. Here we use radiolarian and nannofossil biostratigraphy coupled with detrital zircon geochronology to constrain firmly the time when Asian-derived detritus was first deposited onto India in the classical Sangdanlin section of the central Himalaya, which preserves the best Paleocene stratigraphic record of the distal edge of the Indian continental rise. Deep-sea turbidites of quartzarenite composition and Indian provenance are replaced upsection by turbidites of volcano-plutoniclastic composition and Asian provenance. This sharp transition occurs above abyssal cherts yielding radiolaria of Paleogene radiolarian zones (RP) 4-6 and below abyssal cherts containing radiolaria of zone RP6 and calcareous shales with nannofossils of the Paleocene calcareous nannofossil zone (CNP) 7, constraining the age of collision onset to within the middle Paleocene (Selandian). The youngest U-Pb ages yielded by detrital zircons in the oldest Asia-derived turbidites indicate a maximum depositional age of 58.1 +/- 0.9 Ma. Collision onset is thus mutually constrained by biostratigraphy and detrital zircon chronostratigraphy as 59 +/- 1 Ma. This age is both more accurate and more precise than those previously obtained from the stratigraphic record of the northwestern Himalaya, and suggests that, within the resolution power of current methods, the India-Asia initial collision took place quasi-synchronously in the western and central Himalaya.},

This region records the northernmost sedimentation of the Tethyan passive margin of India, and this time interval represents the transition into continental collision with Asia. The uppermost Cretaceous Zhepure Shanpo and Jidula formations record the transition from pelagic into upper slope to delta-plain environments. The Palaeocenelower Eocene Zongpu Formation records a carbonate ramp that is overlain by the deep-water Enba Formation (lower Eocene). The upper part of the Enba Formation records shallowing into a storm-influenced, outer shelf environment. Detrital zircon UPb and Hf isotopic data indicate that the terrigenous strata of the Enba Formation were sourced from the Lhasa terrane. Unconformably overlying the Enba Formation is the Zhaguo Formation comprising fluvial deposits with evidence of recycling from the underlying successions. Backstripped subsidence analysis indicates shallowing during latest Cretaceous-earliest Palaeocene time (Zhepure Shanpo and Jidula formations) driven by basement uplift, followed by stability (Zongpu Formation) until early Eocene time (Enba Formation) when accelerated subsidence occurred. The provenance, subsidence and stratigraphy suggest that the Enba and Zhaguo formations record foredeep and wedge-top sedimentation respectively within the early Himalayan foreland basin. The underlying Zongpu Formation is interpreted to record the accumulation of a carbonate ramp at the margin of a submarine forebulge. The precursor tectonic uplift during latest Cretaceous time could either record surface uplift over a mantle plume related to the Reunion hotspot, or an early signal of lithospheric flexure related to oceanic subduction, continental collision or ophiolite obduction. The results indicate that the collision of India with Asia occurred before late Danian (ca. 62 Ma) time.},

Detrital zircon U-Pb ages and Hf isotopic data of the Meso-Neoproterozoic (meta)-sedimentary units within the Yili Block constrain the tectonic affinity and early history of the block. Detrital zircon U-Pb ages, in combination with related magmatic age data, indicate that the Tekesi and Kusitai groups were deposited during the latest Mesoproterozoic-earliest Neoproterozoic (1040-960 Ma) and early Neoproterozoic (<926 Ma), respectively. Zircons from the Kusitai Group yield major age groups at 941-910 Ma and 1887-1122 Ma, whereas the Tekesi Group have a dominant age group at ca. 2.0-1.1 Ga with age peaks at ca. 1.9 Ga, 1.8 Ga, 1.75-1.70 Ga, 1.58 Ga, 1.5 Ga, 1.47-1.43 Ga and 1.27-1.20 Ga. A minor age peak of ca. 2.5 Ga is also recognized in the middle part of the Tekesi Group. Early Neoproterozoic detrital zircons with relatively uniform epsilon(Hf)(t) values (+0.7 to +32) were mainly derived from contemporaneous magmatic rocks in the Yili Block. The Central Tianshan Block provides a likely source for detritus with ages of ca. 1.7-1.4 and 25 Ga. The predominant late Paleoproterozoic to latest Mesoproterozoic detrital zircons with positive epsilon(Hf)(t) values (+0.5 to +12.0) in the Yili Block were probably derived primarily from regions exhumed during collisional assembly of Rodinia. These populations are consistent with those from the late Mesoproterozoic-early Neoproterozoic (meta)-sedimentary successions in the Central Tianshan, Kokchetav-North Tianshan and Erementau-Niyaz blocks, and Southeast Siberia and northeastern Laurentia cratons. The Yili Block, together with the Precambrian microcontinents in the southwestern Central Asian Orogenic Belt, was likely located at the margin of Rodinia supercontinent, between the southeast Siberia and northeast Laurentia during the early Neoproterozoic.

U-Pb ages and trace-element and Hf isotopic compositions of detrital zircons from the Late Devonian to earliest early Carboniferous strata in the Yili Basin suggest that the unit contains detritus mainly derived from basement rocks and contemporaneous arc-related volcanic rocks. The age of the unconformable contact between the Dongtujinhe Formation and underlying arc-related volcanic rocks is constrained to ca. 310 Ma. This age is consistent with published data for tectonic exhumation of high- to ultrahigh-pressure ([U]HP) metamorphic rocks from the northern margin of the South Tianshan orogenic belt. Zircon U-Pb ages from the sedimentary rocks, including clasts in conglomerate, indicate that detritus of the Dongtujinhe Formation was derived from multiple sources related to uplift and erosion of the southern Yili-Central Tianshan block. The presence of abundant eclogite clasts in the conglomerate of the Keguqinshan Formation indicates that (U)HP metamorphic rocks in the South Tianshan orogenic belt were exposed and supplied detritus to the southern Yili Basin at ca. 300 Ma. The early Middle Permian clastic rocks are characterized by Early Permian detrital zircons with a single peak at 278 Ma, derived from the postcollision magmatic rocks. During the Late Permian, input of detritus from old volcanic-sedimentary rocks and basement progressively increased. Integration of the provenance data from late Paleozoic strata in the Yili Basin with the time-equivalent northern Tarim and South Tianshan regions provides a record of the northward subduction of the South Tianshan oceanic crust beneath the Yili-Central Tianshan block in the Late Devonian to late Carboniferous (380-310 Ma), followed by continent-continent collision and final amalgamation at ca. 310-300 Ma, with postcollisional extension in the Permian.},

They provide key information for studying the tectonic location relationship between the Yangtze and Qinling blocks and the tectonic-sedimentary environment of the late Neopmterozoic continental margin. This study reports U-Pb and Lu-Hf isotope data of 438 and 408 detrital zircons from five samples of Yaolinghe Group sedimentary rock, collected in the Chengkou area, China. Combining the youngest detrital zircon U-Pb age for gravelly sandstone with data from previous studies, we constrained the maximum depositional time of the Yaolinghe Group sedimentary rocks in this area to ca. 650-635 Ma (i.e., Neoproterozoic Cryogenian). In the Chengkou area, the predominantly Neopmterozoic (1000-635 Ma) detrital zircons, with wide epsilon Hf(t) values ranging from -31.03 to 13.07 and an average of 2.00, were primarily derived from the adjacent regions of exhumed igneous rock in the South Qinling and Northern Yangtze blocks. Several minor age peaks at more than 1000 Ma indicate that this formation contains a small amount of recycled zircon. Further study indicates that the Yaolinghe Group sedimentary rocks were formed by near-source accumulation in a rift setting, located at the north margin of the Yangtze Block, during the breakup of Rodinia. As in previous studies, the retreat of the subducted slab may have led to continental rifting and extension of the Northern Yangtze Block, and the Yaolinghe Group sedimentary rocks in the Chengkou area recording the history of the last stage of Rodinia breakup.},

   abstract = {The South Tianshan Terrane (STT) is located in the boundary between the south-western Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB) and the Tarim Craton and is a key area for understanding the geologic and tectonic history of the craton and the orogenic belt. In this paper, we report detrital zircon ages from the Late Palaeozoic and Mesozoic clastic sedimentary rocks from the southern part of STT. In combination with the U-Pb ages for felsic igneous and meta-igneous rocks exposed in the STT and adjacent tectonic units, we identify several distinct age populations. Provenance analysis suggests that the detrital zircon grains were predominately derived from the felsic magmatic rocks in the Tarim Craton and South Tianshan Terrane. The pre-Neoproterozoic age populations may be associated with the early history of the Tarim Craton. Several pulses of Neoproterozoic magmatism are revealed by our dataset, presumably related to the assembly and break-up of the supercontinent Rodinia. The 995 to 901Ma detrital zircon grains were likely sourced from magmatic rocks associated with the assembly of Neoproterozoic Tarim to Australia. Among the age population of 886 to 752Ma, the older group might be related to the subduction-related magmatism after the assembly of Rodinia, and the younger one records a protracted magmatic event in a continental rift-related setting associated with the break-up of Rodinia. Two younger Neoproterozoic age populations (736 to 694Ma and 665 to 610Ma), showing narrow spreads with weak peaks, represent the waning stages of igneous activities related to the break-up of Rodinia. Regarding the Palaeozoic evolution, together with other evidence, our data indicate a two-stage subduction model for the SW Palaeo-Asian Ocean. The 490 to 384Ma age population corroborates the existence of Early Palaeozoic continental arc magmatism at the northern margin of Palaeozoic Tarim generated by the bidirectional subduction of the South Tianshan Ocean. After a similar to 30My period of tectonomagmatic quiescence, the second stage is marked by the northward subduction of the South Tianshan Terrane during Late Devonian to Early Carboniferous. The final collision of Tarim and the south-western CAOB likely occurred during the Late Carboniferous, followed by syn- and post-collisional magmatism, as represented by the 320 to 265Ma age population. Based on the detrital zircon ages in conjunction with the Hf isotopic features of zircons from Palaeozoic igneous rocks, our study does not support the model of large-scale Phanerozoic net continental growth in the South Tianshan Terrane.},

   abstract = {The tectonic setting of the southwestern Sichuan foreland basin, China, changed rapidly during the Paleogene period, and records from this period may provide crucial information about the formation and tectonic processes that affected the Sichuan Basin. To constrain the provenance and to reconstruct the paleogeography of the Paleogene successions, we conducted a detailed analysis of the petrology, geochronology, and sedimentary facies of rocks from the southwestern Sichuan foreland basin. The detrital components of the three analyzed sandstone samples indicate moderately to highly mature sediment that was primarily derived from a recycled orogen provenance. Five major age populations were identified in the U-Pb age spectra: Neoarchean to Siderian (2524-2469 Ma and 2019-1703 Ma), Neoproterozoic (Tonian to Cryogenian, 946-653 Ma), Ordovician to Carboniferous (Katian to lower Pennsylvanian, 448-321 Ma), and Carboniferous to Triassic (306-201 Ma). Each of these age populations corresponds to one or several potential sources around the southwestern Sichuan foreland basin. A multidimensional scaling analysis indicated that the Paleogene zircons were mainly derived from recycled sediments of the Songpan-Ganzi terrane and the Sichuan Basin, with minor input from the Yidun terrane, Kangdian terrane, Qinling orogenic belt, and Jiangnan-Xuefeng orogenic belt. More specifically, the sediment supply from the Songpan-Ganzi terrane to the foreland basin decreased significantly from the Mingshan stage to the Lushan stage, and the Sichuan Basin simultaneously became the most important source area. In addition, there is a high correlation between the detrital zircon U-Pb age spectrum of the southwestern Sichuan Basin and that of the Xichang Basin, which may suggest that a wider and unified Paleo-Yangtze Basin existed during the Late Cretaceous-early Paleogene.},

We therefore conducted a study of directional structures (34 datasets) and detrital zircons (707 analyses of five samples) from the southeastern margin of the Yangtze Block (SMYB). The principal results are as follows. (1) The sedimentary transport directions indicated by cross-beddings and ripple marks are 295 degrees-354 degrees; the orientation of the relatively deep-water facies indicated by the lateral boundaries of different lithofacies is 332 degrees; and the slumpdirections of sedimentary layers are 324 degrees-359 degrees and 280 degrees-N-31 degrees (or 100 degrees S-211 degrees), based on the syndepositional faults and most of the syndepositional folds, respectively. (2) Detrital zircons have U-Pb ages of 3340-487 Ma, and the U-Pb spectrum of each sample has the same age-peak interval of 900-680Ma. For the late Cryogenian-Ediacaran samples and Cambrian-Ordovician samples, the major age peaks, epsilon(Hf)(t) and Hf-T-DM2 are characterized by similar to 740 Ma, negative values and clustering at 2.6-1.9 Ga, and by similar to 810 Ma, positive values and clustering at 1.5-0.9 Ga, respectively. These new data indicate that, during the Ediacaran to middle Ordovician, the landscape of eastern South China, fromnorth to south, consisted of the following five paleogeographic domains: (i) the Yangtze Sea covering the Yangtze Platform; (ii) the Zhe-Gan-Wan Sea covering the SMYB basin with opposite dips on the north and south sides, and the northeast margin basin of the Cathaysia Block; (iii) the Zhe-Min Land located in the northeastern Cathaysia Block and derived from the Cryogenian land; (iv) the Gan-Min-Zhe Sea covering the northwest and south of the eastern Cathaysia Block; and (v) an unknown land, thatwas located to the south of the eastern Cathaysia Block and underwent the Grenvillian and Pan-African orogenies. According to the landscape configuration, South China may have been a peripheral component of East Gondwana, and the Cathaysia Block may have been adjacent to India, West Australia, and/or East Antarctica.

   abstract = {The subduction polarity and related arc-magmatic evolutional history of the Bangong-Nujiang Ocean, which separated the South Qiangtang terrane to the north from the North Lhasa terrane to the south during the Mesozoic, remain debated. This study tries to reconstruct the subduction and evolution of the Bangong-Nujiang Ocean on the basis of U-Pb and Hf isotopic analyses of detrital zircons in samples from sedimentary rocks of the middle-western section of the Bangong-Nujiang suture zone in Gerze County, central Tibet. The Middle Jurassic Muggargangri Group in the Bangong-Nujiang suture zone was deposited in a deep-sea basin setting on an active continental margin. The Late Jurassic strata, such as the Sewa Formation, are widely distributed in the South Qiangtang terrane and represent deposition on a shelf. The Early Cretaceous Shamuluo Formation in the Bangong-Nujiang suture zone unconformably overlies the Muggargangri Group and was probably deposited in a residual marine basin setting. The detrital zircons of the Muggargangri Group contain seven U-Pb age populations: 2.6-2.4 Ga, 1.95-1.75 Ga, 950-900 Ma, 850-800 Ma, 650-550 Ma, 480-420 Ma, and 350-250 Ma, which is similar to the age populations in sedimentary rocks of the South Qiangtang terrane. In addition, the age spectra of the Shamuluo Formation are similar to those of the Muggargangri Group, indicating that both had a northern terrane provenance, which is conformed by the north-to-south palaeocurrent. This provenance indicates northward subduction of the Bangong-Nujiang oceanic crust. In contrast, two samples from the Sewa Formation yield variable age distributions: the lower sample has age populations similar to those of the South Qiangtang terrane, whereas the upper possesses only one age cluster with a peak at ca. 156 Ma. Moreover, the majority of the late Mesozoic detrital zircons are characterized by weakly positive epsilon(Hf)(t) values that are similar to those of magmatic zircons from arc magmatic rocks in the South Qiangtang terrane. The findings, together with information from the record of magmatism, indicate that the earliest prevalent arc magmatism occurred during the Early Jurassic (ca. 185 Ma) and that the principal arc-magmatic stage occurred during the Middle-Late Jurassic (ca. 170-150 Ma). The magmatic gap and scarcity of detrital zircons at ca. 140-130 Ma likely indicate collision between the Qiangtang and Lhasa terranes. The late Early Cretaceous (ca. 125-100 Ma) magmatism on both sides of the Bangong-Nujiang suture zone was probably related to slab break-off or lithospheric delamination after closure of the Bangong-Nujiang Ocean.},

   abstract = {Linking marine sinks to potential terrestrial sources is one of most intriguing but challenging aspects of sediment source-to-sink studies. In this study, we analyzed 23 zircon samples (3271 filtered best ages) from surface sediments of the east China seas (ECSs) that cover a large portion of the Bohai Sea, Yellow Sea, East China Sea to part of the northeastern South China Sea. The results of U-Pb age distributions exhibit variable signatures in different seas. The Bohai Sea is characterized by 4 age populations at 203-286 Ma, 383-481 Ma, 1830-1940 Ma and 2480-2548 Ma, whereas the southern Yellow Sea and the East China Sea are featured by 5 age populations at 176-223 Ma, 383-481 Ma, 732-830 Ma, 1830-1940 Ma and 2480-2548 Ma. We propose that the presence or absence of the population of 732-830 Ma in the Yangtze Craton (YC) and the North China Craton (NCC) is a possible geochronological signature to distinguish zircon grains derived from the two source regions. Furthermore, on the basis of multidimensional scaling (MDS), U-Pb ages in the sediments of the Bohai Sea, East China Sea and the Taiwan Strait could be correspondently linked to those of the Yellow River, the Yangtze River and Taiwan rivers. The good linkages support the view that U-Pb age distributions of detrital zircons in the margin seas are mainly controlled by fluvial discharges, and ultimately, by the tectonic history of the corresponding source regions. Using a sediment forward mixing model, we obtained the relative sediment contributions and spatial variations of five most important river discharges in the region. The mixing results suggest that the major rivers in the region, i.e., the Yangtze and the Yellow Rivers, are the dominant sediment contributors to the continental margin, and their mixing coefficients could be used to infer relative sediment budgeting. In addition, spatial variations in mixing coefficient in the East China Sea indicate that sediment mixing and partitioning processes in the marine depositional environment have played a part role in propagating the provenance signals as a result of interaction of oceanic currents and tides. The combined method between provenance analysis and mixing modeling provides a feasible way to appreciate sediment budgeting in the geological past.},

   abstract = {Precambrian sedimentary strata are widely distributed along the periphery of the Yangtze Block. However, the age, provenance and tectonic setting of the sedimentary successions on the northern margin still remain unclear, which exerted considerable influence on the understanding of Precambrian crustal evolution of the Yangtze Block. Here we report integrated detrital zircon U-Pb dates and Lu-Hf isotopes from the Dahongshan area to the northeast of the nuclei (i.e. the Kongling Complex) of the Yangtze Block. The youngest U-Pb dates of 995 Ma and 810 Ma of detrital zircon grains place constraints on the maximum depositional ages of the underlying Dagushi Group and the overlying Huashan Group, respectively. Both groups show pre-Mesoproterozoic age populations at ca. 2050 Ma and ca. 2700 Ma and corresponding epsilon(Hf)(t) values varying from -24.1 to + 2.3, consistent with counterparts of the Kongling Complex and Yangpo Complex in northern Yangtze Block. The epsilon(Hf)(t) values of Neoproterozoic (1000-800 Ma) detrital zircon grains in the Huashan Group show a decrease after ca. 880 Ma (from + 13.5 to -18.5), possibly indicating a transition from arc-continent collision to continental arc setting on the northern margin of the Yangtze Block. In combination with sedimentary characteristics and the new isotopic results, the Dagushi Group probably formed in a shallow marine basin setting and received dominant detritus from the Kongling and Yangpo complexes. In contrast, the Huashan Group received sediments recycled from the underlying Dagushi Group and contemporary igneous rocks in the Dahongshan and Kongling areas. The changes in provenance and tectonic setting recorded in the two sedimentary sequences suggest a tectonic transition from late Mesoproterozoic passive continental margin to Neoproterozoic subduction and accretion in response to the amalgamation of Rodinia supercontinent. On the basis of distinct location and history, Pre-Nanhua Neoproterozoic sedimentary sequences distributed in the periphery of Yangtze Block are dispersed into four separate domains. Through bivariate kernel density estimates and bootstrap resampling method, we have identified that these domains were characterized by asynchronous igneous impulse and heterogeneous character of igneous activity in early Neoproterozoic along with varying degrees of integration of crustal growth and reworking.},

   abstract = {The Neoproterozoic Zhoutan Group, located at the conjunction area between the Yangtze and the Cathaysia Blocks, preserves an important record of the Neoproterozoic sedimentary system of the South China Block. However, its accurate depositional age, provenance, and tectonic affinity remain poorly studied. Here, we report new LA-ICP-MS detrital zircon U-Pb age data of four meta-sedimentary samples from the Zhoutan Group in the Nancheng area for complemental decipherment of its sedimentary and tectonic histories. Concordant detrital zircon ages reveal proportions of 54% latest Mesoproterozoic to early Neoproterozoic (ca. 1050-820 Ma), 24% early Paleoproterozoic (ca. 2500-2150 Ma), and 22% late Paleoproterozoic to early Mesoproterozoic (ca. 2000-1500 Ma) populations. Youngest detrital zircon age clusters exhibit a consistent weighted mean age of ca. 827 Ma, suggesting the maximum Tonian depositional age of the Zhoutan Group. Provenance interpretations reveal that the detritus of investigated samples were mainly sourced from the proximal Jiangnan Orogen with some additionally derived from the Cathaysia Block, the interior Yangtze Block, and/or extraneous terranes. In addition, the appearance of some later early Palaeozoic-aged (ca. 437 Ma) metamorphic rims and grains suggest that the Zhoutan Group has locally experienced an intense metamorphism during the early Palaeozoic (Silurian) time, which has been consistently recorded by the Neoproterozoic meta-strata in the Cathaysia Block. These new data, together with those from previous studies, indicate that the Zhoutan Group belongs to the early Neoproterozoic sedimentary successions between the Yangtze and the Cathaysia Blocks. Subsequently, it might be thrusted onto the present side of the Cathaysia Block during later tectonic processes and was affected by locally metamorphism during the Silurian time. Thus, such observations suggest that the potential border between the Yangtze and the Cathaysia Blocks should be to the north of the current position of the Zhoutan Group.},

   abstract = {The Yangtze Block in South China constitutes an important Precambrian landmass in the present East Asian continent. The Neoproterozoic sedimentary successions of the Hengdan Group in the NW Yangtze Block record essential information for deciphering the Neoproterozoic tectonics along the NW margin. However, its depositional age, provenance and tectonic properties remain uncertain. Here, a combined analysis of detrital zircon U-Pb dating and geochemistry is performed on representative samples from the Hengdan Group. Concordant dating results of samples from the bottom and upper parts constrain the maximum depositional age at c. 720 Ma. Detrital zircon age patterns of samples reveal a uniformly pronounced age peak at c. 915-720 Ma, which is consistent with the magmatic pulses in domains at the NW end of the Yangtze Block. In addition, these samples display left-sloping post-Archaean Australian shale (PAAS)-normalized rare-earth element patterns and variable trace element patterns, resembling sediments accumulated in a basin related to an active continental margin geodynamic setting. Provenance analysis reveals that the main sources featured intermediate to felsic components, which experienced rapid erosion and sedimentation. These integrated new investigations, along with previous compilations, indicate that the Hengdan Group might have been deposited in a fore-arc basin controlled by subduction beneath the Bikou Terrane. Thus, such interpretation further supports proposals for subduction-related tectonics along the western margin of the Yangtze Block during the early Neoproterozoic.},

   abstract = {The Chinese Southwest Tianshan Orogenic Belt is located along the boundary between the Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB) and the Tarim Block (TB), NW China. It records the convergence of the Tarim Block and the Middle Tianshan, and is, therefore, a crucial region for understanding the Eurasia continental growth and evolution. The Wulagen (geographical name) metasedimentary rocks of the Wuqia area (mainly metamorphic sandstones and mica schists) form one of the metamorphic terranes in the Southwestern Tianshan Orogenic Belt. The geochronology of these rocks is poorly known, which hampers our understanding of the tectonic evolution of the belt. We analyzed 517 zircon grains for detrital zircon U-Pb dating and 93 zircon grains for in situ Lu-Hf isotopic compositions from the Wulagen metasedimentary rocks. The analyzed zircon grains yield Neoarchean to late Paleozoic U-Pb ages with major age peaks at similar to 2543 Ma, 1814 Ma, 830 Ma, 460 Ma, and the youngest cluster of zircon (magmatogene) ages is 395 Ma. The zircon U-Pb data show that the late Paleozoic (Early Devonian) is the maximum depositional age of the Wulagen metasedimentary rocks, rather than the previously considered Precambrian period. The zircons with Paleozoic ages yield epsilon Hf(t) values of -22.0 to +11.3 and two-stage model ages (TDM2) of 3.95 to 1.30 Ga, suggesting that the parental magmas were formed from partial melting of pre-existing crustal rocks. Our zircon U-Pb geochronology and Hf isotopic data indicate the major source regions for the Wulagen metasedimentary rocks was the Kyrgyzstan North Tianshan. The zircon age population of 600-400 Ma (peak at similar to 460 Ma) has negative epsilon Hf(t) values (-15.0 to -0.6) and Mesoproterozoic two-stage model ages, suggesting that the early Paleozoic magmatism resulted mainly from the melting of ancient crust, which played an important role in crustal evolution in the southern CAOB.},

   abstract = {In order to examine paleogeographic link between Primorye and Japan with respect to other continental blocks in East Asia, middle-upper Paleozoic shallow marine sandstones of the Khanka block and Sergeevka belt were analyzed by LA-ICPMS U-Pb dating of detrital zircons. The age spectra of detrital zircons of the Devonian Lyutorgian Formation, Lower Carboniferous Shevelevka Formation, and Permian Lyudyanza Formation in the Vladivostok-Nakhodka area share more or less the same age range; the majority of detrital zircons are dated 500-400 Ma (Cambrian to Silurian). These ages are common in previously dated granitoids with arc signature in Primorye and also in Japan, thus suggest a probable derivation from a single subduction-related Paleozoic batholith belt along the Pacific rim. The zircon age spectra of the Devonian and Carboniferous sandstones show similarities to those of coeval sandstones in NE and SW Japan. The middle-late Paleozoic sedimentary basins in Primorye and Japan commonly had a provenance featuring early Paleozoic arc rocks. In addition, all of these Paleozoic terrigenous clastics in Primorye and Japan consistently contain Proterozoic zircons. Occurrence of Meso- to Neoproterozoic (ca. 1500 and 600 Ma) grains positively suggests a link to the South China block, as other blocks in East Asia lack crusts of this age of pan-African affinity. The common age spectra of detrital zircons of the Paleozoic sandstones in southern Primorye and NE-SW Japan support the concept of "Greater South China" that is comprised of conterminous South China to extend to Japan/Primorye, which is consistent with the mutual similarities recognized in Paleozoic marine fauna. Paleozoic South China was much larger than previously imagined, and this greater size, almost double the present conterminous South China, requires much larger area in the paleogeographical reconstruction of Rodinia.},

   abstract = {The palaeogeographic and tectonic setting of the Lower Jurassic Nishinakayama Formation (Toyora Group, southwest Japan) is interpreted based on new U-Pb ages for detrital zircon grains separated from a sandstone sample, combined with available provenance data. The newly obtained age spectrum of detrital zircon grains is characterized by multiple age clusters. Specifically, (1) nearly syndepositional (Lower Jurassic; 182-200 Ma), (2) Early Permian to Late Triassic (205-288 Ma), and (3) Precambrian (1,855-2,660 Ma). The youngest zircon age (182.4 +/- 5.1 Ma) is consistent with the biostratigraphically constrained depositional age (falciferum ammonite Zone, lower Toarcian). The presence of a near-syndepositional age cluster, as well as the presence of volcanic tuff layers in the studied succession, indicates the likely extensive influence of an active volcanic arc in the depositional area. The age cluster of 205-288 Ma suggests, in contrast, that older granitic batholiths were also being sourced. Precambrian detrital zircon grains would have been derived from continental blocks with mainly Proterozoic crusts, most likely from the North China Craton. When combined with available geochemical, petrological, and palaeontological data, our detrital zircon data demonstrate that deposition of the Nishinakayama Formation was located at an active continental margin, possibly close to the northern extremity of the South China Craton. Abundant terrigenous clastics were likely supplied to the sedimentary basin from the Qinling-Dabieshan-Sulu Suture Zone, which was formed by the collision of the North and South China cratons.},

   abstract = {The spatial-temporal development of Cenozoic reactivation along Mesozoic suture zones in the Tibetan Plateau are first-order parameters needed for assessing models of plateau growth. The Ganzi-Litang suture, in the eastern Tibetan Plateau, developed in the Late Triassic because of subduction and closure along the eastern branch of the Paleo-Tethys Ocean. Near the city of Litang, the Ganzi-Litang suture is defined by a melange sequence with faultbound, synorogenic nonmarine strata along the western and eastern flanks, suggesting post-Triassic structural reactivation. We present detrital zircon U-Pb geochronology and field data to determine the timing and style of reactivation along the Ganzi-Litang suture, as well as sedimentary provenance of nonmarine strata. A reverse fault placing melange rock on top of nonmarine strata along the eastern flank of the Ganzi-Litang suture indicates a contractional deformational regime during reactivation. Conglomerate class counts indicate a local sediment source of recycled Ganzi-Litang suture and Yidun terrane rock. Detrital zircons indicate a localized provenance consisting of recycled material from Triassic Yidun Arc plutons and Triassic Yidun Group turbidite rock. A weighted mean average of Cenozoic zircon grains (n = 10) establishes a maximum depositional age of 41.5 +/- 1.2 Ma for nonmarine strata in the Ganzi-Litang suture. We interpret the maximum depositional age of the nonmarine strata to represent the upper-limit for structural reactivation along the Ganzi-Litang suture while undeformed Neogene strata in the suture zone represent the lower-limit; thereby bracketing structural reactivation from ca. 42-25 Ma. Our results provide enhanced spatial-temporal resolution for Cenozoic deformation in the eastern Tibetan Plateau.},

   abstract = {To advance tectonic models of plateau growth in response to the India-Asia collision, parameters such as the timing, mechanism (s), and extent of Cenozoic deposition and deformation throughout the eastern Tibetan Plateau need to be determined. To better understand these parameters, we examine the Mula basin, located in the southern Yidun terrane, using field data, detrital zircon geochronology, epsilon Hf zircon isotopic values, and thin section petrology. The Mula basin is a NW-SE elongate (28km long and 5-8km wide) exposure of nonmarine strata 1,000m thick, deposited in alluvial environments. The basin is bound to the northeast by a thrust fault (327, 34 degrees NE) that places Triassic Daocheng Pluton and Triassic Yidun Group rocks on top of the nonmarine strata. The western boundary is defined by an unconformable contact between the overlying nonmarine strata and Triassic Daocheng Pluton and Yidun Group rock. An intrabasin thrust fault, parallel to the basin-bounding fault, places older nonmarine strata on top of younger nonmarine strata, illustrating postdepositional deformation. Provenance results indicate that sediment influx originated primarily from localized drainage catchments and lacked major, well-organized throughgoing systems. A maximum depositional age of 45.50.5Ma, based on the weighted mean average of the youngest detrital zircon population (s), demonstrates an Eocene or younger age for strata. We interpret the Mula basin to have developed in a contractional deformational regime driven by a far-field, upper-crustal response associated with the transition from an Andean style margin to a continent-continent collisional margin as India impinged upon Eurasia.

The U-Pb detrital zircon ages from the Early Paleozoic strata of the Taebaeksan Zone suggest a Cambrian maximum deposition age, and are supported by trilobite and conodont biostratigraphy. Although the age spectra from two sedimentary groups, the Yeongwol and Taebaek Groups, show similar continuous distributions from the Late Paleoproterozoic to Early Paleozoic ages, a Grenville-age hiatus (1.3-0.9 Ga) in the continuous stratigraphic sequence from the Taebaek Group suggests the existence of different peripheral clastic sources along rifted continental margin(s). In addition, we present the K-Ar illite 1M(d)/1M ages of the fault gouges, which confirm fault formation/reactivation during the Late Cretaceous to Early Paleogene (ca. 82-62 Ma) and the Early Miocene (ca. 20-18 Ma). The 2M(1) illite ages, at least those younger than the host rock ages, provide episodes of deformation, metamorphism and hydrothermal effects related to the tectonic events during the Devonian (ca.410 Ma) and Permo-Triassic (ca. 285-240 Ma). These results indicate that the northeastern Okcheon Belt experienced polyphase orogenic events, namely the Okcheon (Middle Paleozoic), Songrim (Late Paleozoic to Early Mesozoic), Daebo (Middle Mesozoic) and Bulguksa (Late Mesozoic to Early Cenozoic) Orogenies, reflecting the Phanerozoic tectonic evolution of the Korean Peninsula along the East Asian continental margin.},

   abstract = {U- Pb zircon ages of tuffs and sandstones of the Daedong Supergroup (Bansong and Nampo groups) in the Korean Peninsula were determined using a sensitive high- resolution ion microprobe (SHRIMP) in order to constrain their age of sedimentation and to unravel discrete geologic events as recorded in detrital zircons. The ages of four tuffaceous samples from the Bansong Group imply that the Daedong Supergroup formed at ca. 187 - 172 Ma in association with the Early- Middle Jurassic orogeny. These data are in marked contrast with paleomagnetic arguments suggesting that the Bansong and Nampo groups are precollisional Early- Middle Triassic deposits that are correlative with the North and South China blocks, respectively. Detrital zircons of the Daedong Supergroup define seven age components: (1) Early- Middle Archean (3.64 - 2.97 Ga), (2) Late Archean - middle Early Proterozoic (2.63 - 2.33 Ga), ( 3) late Early Proterozoic (1.98 - 1.75 Ga), (4) Middle- Late Proterozoic (1.2 - 0.6 Ga), ( 5) Devonian (400 - 355 Ma), (6) Early Permian (280 255 Ma), and (7) Middle Triassic - Early Jurassic (240 - 180 Ma). These age distributions, together with available geochronological data, suggest that crustal growth of the Korean Peninsula has continued since ca. 3.6 Ga and culminated at ca. 2.5 and 1.9 - 1.8 Ga. Major age populations of detrital zircons of the Bansong and Nampo groups are similar, except for the presence of Middle-Late Proterozoic ages in the latter. Inasmuch as these ages are characteristic for the South China Block, the Gyeonggi massif, or at least the local source of the Nampo Group, is most likely a correlative of the South China Block.},

   abstract = {The Bogda Mountains, as an important intracontinental orogenic belt, are situated in the southern part of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB), and are a key area for understanding the Mesozoic evolution of the CAOB. However, the tectonic evolution of the Bogda Mountains remains controversial during the Mesozoic Era, especially the Early to Middle Jurassic Periods. The successive Lower to Middle Jurassic strata are well preserved and exposed along the northern flank of the Western Bogda Mountains and record the uplift processes of the Bogda Mountains. In this study, we analysed sedimentary facies combined with detrital zircon U-Pb geochronology at five sections of Lower to Middle Jurassic strata to detect the tectonic evolution and changes of provenance in the Bogda area. During Early to Middle Jurassic times, the fluvial, deltaic and lacustrine environments dominated in the western section of the Bogda area. The existence of Early Triassic peak age indicates that the Bogda Mountains did not experience uplift during the period of early Badaowan Formation deposition. The Early Triassic to Late Permian granitoid plutons and Carboniferous volcanic rocks from the Barkol and Santanghu areas were the main provenances. The significant change in the U-Pb age spectrum implies that the Eastern Bogda Mountains initiated uplift in the period of late Badaowan Formation deposition, and the Eastern Junggar Basin and the Turpan-Hami Basin were partially partitioned. The Eastern Bogda Mountains gradually became the major provenance. From the period of early Sangonghe to early Toutunhe Formations deposition, the provenance of the sediments and basin-range frame were similar to that of late Badaowan. However, the Eastern Bogda Mountains suffered intermittent uplift three times, and successive denudation. The uplifts respectively happened in early Sangonghe, late Sangonghe to early Xishanyao, and late Xishanyao to early Toutunhe. During the deposition stage of Toutunhe Formation, a relatively strong tectonic reactivation took place along the Late Palaeozoic Bogda rift belt accompanied by relatively large-scale magmatism. The distinct basement structure between the eastern and western Bogda rift could be the structure basis of difference uplift in the Bogda area during the Mesozoic Era. The Early to Middle Jurassic episodic uplift of Eastern Bogda Mountains perhaps was related to the post-collisional convergence of the Qiangtang Block from late Badaowan to early Sangonghe, the closure of the western Mongol-Okhotsk Ocean at the Early-Middle Jurassic boundary and the tectonic accretion at the south Asian margin of Pamir Block during late Middle Jurassic times.},

   abstract = {The depositional and metamorphic ages and provenances of the Ailaoshan (ALS) Group in the Ailaoshan-Red River (ALS-RR) shear zone, southwestern South China Block (SCB), were investigated to constrain the tectonic history of the southwestern SCB. In this study, we use petrology, geochemical analysis, zircon cathodoluminescence imaging and U-Pb geochronology to analyse samples of quartzite, garnet-bearing two-mica schist and metapelite. The age spectra of detrital zircon grains from these metasediments show two dominant age peaks at 550-424 Ma and 876-730 Ma and two subordinate peaks at 970-955 Ma and similar to 2450 Ma. The youngest peak, corresponding to the early Palaeozoic, accounts for more than 20% of the total dates and constrains the deposition of the ALS Group to the Palaeozoic rather than the Palaeoproterozoic as traditionally thought. Moreover, two peaks of metamorphic ages corresponding to the Permo-Triassic and Cenozoic were also identified, and these ages document the tectonothermal events associated with the Indosinian collision between the Indochina Block and the SCB and the Himalayan collision between the Indian and Asian plates. Geochemical data suggest that the provenances of the ALS Group were dominated by continental arc and recycled metasedimentary rocks. The comparison of probability density distribution plots of the detrital zircon U-Pb age data indicates that the Neoproterozoic detritus in the ALS Group was probably derived from the arc-related Neoproterozoic intrusive bodies in the northwestern and southwestern SCB. Furthermore, the early Palaeozoic detritus might have been sourced from eroded early Palaeozoic strata and magmatic plutons in Cathaysia and volcanic rocks in the western Indochina Block.},

   abstract = {Devonian quartzite occurs as blocks within a phyllite matrix in Puziba area of the Mianlue Suture Zone (MLSZ) in central China. The depositional time of the quartzite is younger than 425 Ma (mainly Early Devonian), constrained by the zircon U-Pb geochronology data from the quartzite, cross-cutting relationships with granite, and palaeontology evidence. The detrital zircons in the quartzite show typical magmatic features with four main age peaks at: 2676-2420 Ma (11.6% of the population), 1791-1606 Ma (4.8%), 997-817 Ma (26.5%), and 597-425 Ma (17.5%). In combination with the zircon epsilon Hf(t) values, we propose that the quartzite in the MLSZ was sourced from Neoproterozoic and Palaeozoic magmatic and sedimentary rocks in the South Qinling Block and the South China Block (particularly from the Bikou Terrane), with minor contributions from Archaean and Palaeoproterozoic magmatic units from both of the South and North China blocks. The blocks of quartzite, slate, marble, metasandstone, and chert blocks in the phyllite matrix in the Puziba area show a typical block-in-matrix texture in a tectonic melange, and provide significant evidence from sedimentary rock blocks rather than ophiolite or volcanic rock for the existence of the MLSZ.},

   abstract = {U-Pb isotope ages of detrital zircons from psammitic rocks of the Sanbagawa Belt in eastern Kii Peninsula, Japan, were determined by laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. The age spectra patterns allow four sedimentary types to be distinguished on the basis of dominant zircon age proportions: Permian-Jurassic, Cretaceous, Precambrian and Mixed types. Combining the age data with geological features in the area, we subdivide this belt into the Mayoidake, Hachisu, Kayumi, and Haze complexes, with their deposition-accretion ages estimated as 116-95, 103-84, 98-76, and 76-73 Ma, respectively. The Mayoidake Complex is dominated by Permian-Jurassic-type sediments, whereas the Haze Complex is dominated by Precambrian-type sediments. Cretaceous-type and Mixed-type sediments are found in the Kayumi and Hachisu complexes. Most of the Cretaceous zircons are inferred to have been derived from a Late Cretaceous volcanic arc on the eastern margin of the Eurasian continent, whereas the Precambrian zircons are interpreted to have been sourced from basement of the North China Block. By also considering results of previous studies, we conclude that the Mayoidake Complex belongs to the neighboring Shimanto Accretionary Complex rather than the Sanbagawa Metamorphic Rocks. Furthermore, detrital zircon U-Pb age spectra for the interval 100-95 Ma differ between the Mayoidake and Hachisu complexes. This difference suggests that the depositional basin of the Sanbagawa Metamorphic Rocks was separate and lay some distance from that of the Shimanto Accretionary Complex, with the two belts finally being juxtaposed by lateral displacement along a steeply dipping strike-slip.},

   abstract = {The Pamir is the northwestward continuation of the Tibet-Himalaya orogen and translated similar to 50-300 km northward toward the Tian Shan in Mesozoic-Cenozoic times. Although this region has been studied extensively over the past few decades, our knowledge of the timing of mountain building in the Pamir is incomplete. In this study, we applied provenance analyses of Cretaceous-Pliocene sediments from the Tierekesazi section in the Pamir-Tian Shan corridor to reconstruct the Cenozoic evolution of the Pamir-Tian Shan orogens. Provenance data from new detrital zircon U-Pb ages and paleocurrent measurements indicate that the main source area of sediments in the studied section shifted from the Tian Shan to the Northern Pamir at similar to 41-40 Ma. When combined with published provenance data, eastward decreasing sediment transport distances suggest that the Pamir was characterized by an asymmetric drainage system with larger drainage basins developed in the western Pamir than the eastern Pamir since the late Eocene. This resulted from either eastward decrease in precipitation rate caused by the uplift of the Pamir orocline or relatively low topography of the western Pamir. Furthermore, observed east and south directed paleocurrents and a dominance of Paleozoic detrital zircon U-Pb ages in the upper Miocene-Pliocene sediments suggest the SW Tian Shan was uplifted and became the primary provenance of the Tierekesazi section in the late Miocene. Simultaneously, the thrust belt of the Pamir propagated into its northern foreland and the present-day east flowing drainage system in the eastern Pamir-Tian Shan convergence zone was established in the late Miocene.},

   abstract = {Being one of the largest intra-continental orogens of the world, the Tian Shan orogenic belt was uplifted to its present elevation due to the far-field effect of the India-Asia convergence. In this study, we performed a systematic study on the Upper Oligocene-Quaternary sedimentary rocks from the southern Junggar basin, including conglomerate clast counting and detrital zircon U-Pb dating, to reconstruct the Late Cenozoic uplift history of the northern Tian Shan mountain range. The new detrital zircon U-Pb data provide new constrains on the Late Cenozoic intra-continental deformation of the Borohoro range. The Yili-Central Tian Shan and North Tian Shan were the major sources for the Junggar basin during the Latest Cretaceous-Paleogene period. At that time, the Borohoro range was characterized by low topography and wide drainage pattern. As the uplift of the North Tian Shan commenced at similar to 25-23 Ma, the high topography of the northern Borohoro range blocked the transport of sediments from the Yili-Central Tian Shan to the north. The North Tian Shan became the primary provenance area of the southern Junggar basin. According to sedimentary provenance analysis and geomorphologic survey, we infer that the Yili-Central Tian Shan started to uplift at 12-9 Ma. Combined with previously published data, our results suggest that the Middle Miocene uplift event most likely occurred in both the hinterland and foreland regions along the whole Tian Shan mountain range.},

   abstract = {The Permian-Triassic successions in the Bogda Mountains, northern Xinjiang, northwest China, record a pivotal but poorly constrained tectonic regime of a transtensional rift, which can be subdivided into synrift, post-rift, and uplift stages. Systematic sandstone petrography, whole-rock geochemistry, and detrital-zircon U-Pb dating analysis were conducted to evaluate the source-to-sink process involved, as well as to understand its provenance characteristics and the factors that control the source-to-sink evolution. Comprehensive provenance analytical methods indicate that the sediments in the syn-rift and post-rift stages experienced weak chemical weathering and were compositionally immature, poorly sorted, and mostly acidic, with few basic volcanic rocks from North Tianshan (NTS) and Central Tianshan (CTS). Meanwhile in the uplift stage, the sediments underwent moderate chemical weathering and sedimentary recycling, with a complex age population, containing syndepositional zircon ages, which were likely derived from the volcanic rocks of NTS, CTS, and the Bogda Mountains. Integrated provenance analyses reveal that the syn-rift and post-rift source-to-sink systems of Bogda rift (and probably other rift basins) are controlled mainly by tectonics, the sinks are principally immature, and the sources are derived predominantly from axial volcanic arcs and local rift shoulders, with little input from syndepositional volcanic rocks. Inversely, the source-to-sink system of the uplift stage is rather complex, which is influenced by tectonics, climate, and sedimentary processes. Their sinks are relatively submature to mature, and their sources include detritus, with ages close to the depositional age, along with significant input from surrounding volcanic arcs and initial uplift highlands.},

   abstract = {The Eastern Kunlun Range, as a high-elevation and granitoid-rich tectonic element in northern Tibet, records Paleozoic-Mesozoic amalgamation process of the East Asia continent and Cenozoic uplift of the Tibetan Plateau. However, Precambrian evolution of the Eastern Kunlun remains poorly understood and relations between Eastern Kunlun and adjacent terranes (e.g., Qaidam and Qilian) during the Phanerozoic accretion process are still highly controversial. We use detrital zircon U-Pb geochronological and Hf isotopic data of Proterozoic and Paleozoic metasedimentary rocks from the Eastern Kunlun Range, to reconstruct its origin and subsequent evolutionary history. Detrital zircons of the Proterozoic rocks are dominated by early-middle Neoproterozoic ages (700-1000 Ma), with two age peaks at ca. 800 Ma and ca. 920 Ma and epsilon Hf(t) values ranging from -10 to 5. The youngest detrital zircon ages (648-788 Ma) demonstrate that these investigated Proterozoic strata, which were previously mapped as Paleoproterozoic to Mesoproterozoic, were most likely deposited in the middlelate Neoproterozoic. Abundant 0.9-1.0 Ga detrital zircon crystals are consistent with those crystalline rocks of similar ages across the Kunlun-Qaidam and Qilian terranes, which are generally interpreted as the product of Grenvillian orogenesis. These findings support the hypothesis that these terranes were probably within a single continental landmass (named as KQQ block) during the Neoproterozoic. The high similarity of detrital zircon ages, Hf isotopes and Neoproterozoic lithostratigraphy between western Yangtze and KQQ blocks, supports a temporary connection of the KQQ block to western Yangtze in Rodinia supercontinent. Detrital zircons of the analyzed Paleozoic rocks are characterized by 390-490 Ma age populations.These results, in combination with published granitoids data of the northern Tibet, favor a scenario in which the Kunlun-Qaidam and Qilian terranes underwent separated subduction and accretion processes during the late Cambrian-Devonian, but together formed an upper plate to northward subduction of the Palco-Tethys during the Permian-Triassic.

   abstract = {To investigate the tectonic framework of the basement of the Cathaysia Block, we selected the representative Cambrian strata in different parts of the South Wuyi area along the southern Nanping-Ninghua-Ganzhou Tectonic Belt (NNGTB). Integrated petrographic and geochronologic studies, as well as geochemical analysis, were carried out on the low-grade metasedimentary rocks of the Niujiaohe Formation in south Jiangxi Province and the Lintian Formation in south-west Fujian Province. The metasedimentary rocks of the Niujiaohe and Lintian formations are dominated by metasandstones and metasiltstones. They have low chemical index of alteration (52.6-77.4) and high index of compositional variability (0.84-1.42) values, suggesting weak chemical weathering and low clastic maturity. Their relatively low Th/U (4.12-6.81) and Rb/Sr (0.68-5.97) ratios reflect a simple recycling history. Detrital zircon geochronological studies indicate prominent source differences for the clastic rocks along the NNGTB. In the Ruijin area, the Niujiaohe Formation displays a Neoproterozoic peak at ca. 741 Ma, which is consistent with the widespread intermediate-acid igneous rocks in the NNGTB. By contrast, the Lintian Formation from the Changting and Mingxi areas contains more pre-Nanhuan detritus, which are predominantly in Grenvillian ages. Furthermore, the peak numbers of detrital zircon ages increase gradually from the Ruijin to Changting and Mingxi areas, indicating that their sources become more diverse. The geochemical features, in combination with detrital zircon age distributions, indicate that the Niujiaohe and Lintian formations are probably deposited in a back-arc basin. These evidences suggest that the Cathaysia Block was assembled by multiple terranes during the Neoproterozoic to the Early Palaeozoic.},

   abstract = {The well-preserved Cenozoic sedimentary record in the Yinggehai Basin, South China Sea, is suitable to explore the tectonic and climatic evolution of SE Asia. Red River, a large-scale fluvial system in this region, was previously regarded as the major sediment source for the basin. Here we combine heavy mineral analysis and detrital zircon U-Pb dating to shed new light on the middle Miocene-Pliocene provenance evolution at a basin scale. The results clearly reveal potential source areas additional to the Red River. Sediments have been delivered to the proximal areas from Hainan Island, as indicated by the high zircon content and the Yanshanian U-Pb ages in the southern segment of the Yingdong Slope. A provenance from Central Vietnam is explicitly discemed in the upper Miocene of the Central Depression, where sediments are characterized by few metamorphic heavy minerals and the U-Pb age pattern peaking at around 250 Ma and 440 Ma. Coeval large-scale relative sea-level fall and rapid exhumation along the Vietnamese margin together may have facilitated this long-distance sediment transport. Provenance of sediments from the Red River seems to change over time. Song Lo River, on the north side of the main stream, probably flowed from the NE and carried Neoproterozoic-early Paleozoic zircons to the Yinggehai Basin during the middle Miocene. Since the late Miocene, rocks along the Red River Fault Zone have become the dominant source. Subsequently, widespread metamorphic minerals in the Central Depression of the Yinggehai Basin, combined with the strong river incision and high offshore sedimentation rates, indicate an increased sediment supply from the Red River in the Pliocene.

   abstract = {Neoproterozoic to early Paleozoic accretionary processes of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt have been evaluated so far mainly using the geology of ophiolites and/or magmatic arcs. Thus, the knowledge of the nature and evolution of associated sedimentary prisms remains fragmentary. We carried out an integrated geological, geochemical, and zircon U-Pb geochronological study on a giant Ordovician metasedimentary succession of the Mongolian Altai Mountains. This succession is characterized by dominant terrigenous components mixed with volcanogenic material. It is chemically immature, compositionally analogous to graywacke, and marked by significant input of felsic to intermediate arc components, pointing to an active continental margin depositional setting. Detrital zircon U-Pb ages suggest a source dominated by products of early Paleozoic magmatism prevailing during the Cambrian-Ordovician and culminating at circa 500Ma. We propose that the Ordovician succession forms an Altai sedimentary wedge, the evolution of which can be linked to the geodynamics of the margins of the Mongolian Precambrian Zavhan-Baydrag blocks. This involved subduction reversal from southward subduction of a passive continental margin (Early Cambrian) to the development of the Ikh-Mongol Magmatic Arc System and the giant Altai sedimentary wedge above a north dipping subduction zone (Late Cambrian-Ordovician). Such a dynamic process resembles the tectonic evolution of the peri-Pacific accretionary Terra Australis Orogen. A new model reconciling the Baikalian metamorphic belt along the southern Siberian Craton with peri-Pacific Altai accretionary systems fringing the Mongolian microcontinents is proposed to explain the Cambro-Ordovician geodynamic evolution of the Mongolian collage system.},

Previous studies revealed that these Carboniferous-Permian zircons occurred in the Northern Ordos Basin mainly originated from the Yinshan Block. What has not been well documented until now is where this period's zircons in the Southern Ordos Basin came from, and very little discussion about their provenance. To identify the provenance of the detrital zircons dating from 350 to 260 Ma, five sandstone samples from the Shan 1 Member of Shanxi Formation and eight sandstone samples from the He 8 Member of Shihezi Formation were analyzed for detrital zircon U-Pb age dating and in situ Lu-Hf isotopic compositions. The results indicate that the two age clusters of 520-378 Ma and 350-260 Ma in the Southern Ordos Basin most likely derived from the North Qinling Orogenic Belt-North Qilian Orogenic Belt and the North Qinling Orogenic Belt, respectively. Furthermore, we propose that the zircons aging 320-260 Ma are representative of the important tectonothermal events occurred in the North Qinling Orogenic Belt during the Late Paleozoic.},

   abstract = {Detrital zircon U-Pb dating, Hf isotopic data, and Nd isotopic compositions of river sediments are used to constrain crustal evolution processes of their provenance in the South Qilian orogenic belt. The detrital zircons from the Yuka, Tataleng, and Bayinguole rivers range in age from Neoarchean (2,772 Ma) to Permian (261 Ma), with age peaks at ca. 2.4 Ga, ca. 1.95 Ga, and ca. 0.45 Ga. Hf isotopic compositions of Paleoproterozoic, Pan-African, and Caledonian zircon age groups display a wide range of epsilon(Hf)(t) values, suggesting diverse sources of host magma of the zircon grains. The basement formation of the South Qilian orogenic belt from depleted mantle occurred at two stages; ca. 3.1-2.5 Ga and ca. 2.0-1.6 Ga. Meanwhile, the Nd model ages of silt-mud from the region are between 1.98 Ga and 2.27 Ga with an average value of 2.12 Ga. Our study indicates that the Qilian oceanic plate formed between the Qaidam and Alxa blocks from late Neoproterozoic to Silurian. The South Qilian orogenic belt is a product of the Qilian Ocean closure and subsequent collision between the Qaidam Block and central Qilian belt during Ordovician-Silurian times. Combining regional tectonothermal events with new results of river sediments suggests that rifting from a continent and opening of the Qilian Ocean occurred at ca. 780-520 Ma, subduction of the oceanic crust at ca. 520-440 Ma, ocean closure and continental subduction at ca. 440-420 Ma, exhumation of subducted crust at ca. 420-400 Ma, and orogenic collapse and extension at ca. 400-360 Ma.},

   abstract = {The North Qilian Orogenic Belt (NQOB) is an important element of the northern edge of the Tibetan Plateau, and several rivers run along it. Zircon U-Pb dating, trace elements, and Hf isotopic data derived from the sediments carried by the rivers have been used to deduce the crustal evolution of the NQOB. U-Pb ages obtained from detrital zircons found in the sediments of the Zamu, Zhuanglan, and Beida rivers can be divided into five major age groups, that is, 2,600-1,500, 1,500-1,100, 1,100-650, 550-400, and 360-150 Ma, and the corresponding peaks occur at similar to 2,450, similar to 1,750, similar to 950, similar to 450, and similar to 250 Ma. Archean components, which may be derived from the ancient continental nucleus in the region, are rare in the river sediments. The zircon grains with ages of 360-150 Ma are most likely related to crustal thickening and decompression melting in a post-collisional tectonic setting. The age distribution patterns indicate that the sediments carried by the Zamu, Zhuanglang, and Beida rivers are derived from the NQOB. Furthermore, the Hf isotopic compositions of Meso- and Neoarchean, Mesoproterozoic, Grenvillian, Pan-African, Caledonian, and Hercynian zircon age groups exhibit a wide range of epsilon(Hf) (t) values, suggesting diverse sources. The existence of strongly negative epsilon(Hf) (t) values among the Grenvillian and Paleoproterozoic zircons indicates that the source magma included reworked Palaeoarchean crustal materials. New results indicate that continental rifting and the opening of the Qilian Ocean occurred at 775-520 Ma; the subduction and closure of the Qilian Ocean occurred at 520-440 Ma; arc-continent collision and continental subduction occurred at 440-420 Ma; and orogen collapse and extension occurred at 400-360 Ma. Our study indicates that the formation of the NQOB was mainly related to the evolutionary history of the Proto-Tethys Ocean.},

   abstract = {Tectonic processes from the breakup of Rodinia to Gondwana assembly have been studied on large continents. However, the role of micro-continental blocks in Neoproterozoic supercontinental cycle is barely known. Geochronological and geochemical studies on a combination of 57 (meta-) sedimentary and (meta-) igneous rocks (one igneous rock and four meta-sedimentary samples are from this study) in the Indochina block (including its north part, i.e. the Simao terrane) reveal the paleoposition and tectonic processes during Precambrian supercontinental cycle. A mylonitized monzogranite from the NW part of the Indochina block (the Chongshan area) shows zircon U-Pb ages of 867 +/- 19 Ma. Precambrian and Early Paleozoic strata share similar zircon U-Pb age peaks at ca. 2.5 Ga and ca. 0.95 Ga. The ca. 1.75 Ga age peak in the Precambrian strata is absent in those Early Paleozoic strata. The newly discovered 867 +/- 19 Ma felsic intrusion in the Chongshan Metamorphic Belt and the shift of detrital zircon age patterns from the Neoproterozoic to Early Paleozoic confirm the presence of Precambrian magmatic activities in the Indochina block. Paleoposition and magmatic records show the Indochina block should be part of an Andean-type orogeny along the NW margin of the Rodinia during the Neoproterozoic. During the Neoproterozoic to Early Paleozoic, the role of Indochina as a continental block coherent with the Indian Craton at least during the breakup of Rodinia and Gondwana assembly. After Gondwana assembly, the Indochina block, as a section of an Andean-type continental arc along the eastern margin, blocked the exotic inputs and changed the age distribution patterns dramatically.

   abstract = {Detrital zircons from a Palaeoproterozoic quartzite, deposited between 1.85 and 1.82 Ga in the northern Aravalli orogen of NW India, show a distinctive age peak of ca. 1.85 Ga and variable, but largely subchondritic epsilon Hf-1.85 Ga between -1.3 and -21.0 corresponding to hafnium model ages of 2.5 to 3.6 Ga. These data indicate an important period of reworking of ancient (Eo- to Neoarchaean), strongly heterogeneous continental crust at this time. Prevalence of ca. 1.85 Ga subduction-related granitoids, almost identical U-Pb age spectra and epsilon Hf-t of detrital zircons in ca. 1.85 Ga metasedimentary rocks in the Aravalli orogen and the inner Lesser Himalaya indicate similar sediment provenances and thus a geological connection between these two terranes during late Palaeoproterozoic. All together, the data constrain a rapid succession of sedimentation, metamorphism and subduction-related magmatic activity and support the interpretation of an active geodynamic realm along the entire north Indian margin at ca. 1.85 Ga. Comparison of detrital zircon data in conjunction with published paleomagnetic data from north India and other crustal blocks of the Columbia supercontinent, additionally, suggest a close affinity of north India with Madagascar, the Cathaysia block of South China and South Korea during Columbia times.

   abstract = {The Kontum Massif and the Truong Son Belt, central Vietnam are the magmatic-metamorphic massifs (belts) of the Indochina Block. These two massifs (belts) underwent two independent orogenic events during OrdovicianSilurian and Permian-Triassic ages. However, due to the strong overprint of these two orogenic events, the evidence of any preexisting (e.g., Precambrian) tectono-thermal events have become extremely poor. Hence, the Precambrian age components of the Indochina Block have not been fully revealed, and their implication is not well-understood. It is well known that such `lost memories' of the older continental rocks or source crustal materials are sometimes preserved in the sedimentary basins. Keeping that goal in mind, we have investigated the LA-ICP-MS detrital zircon U-Pb dating for three sedimentary and metasedimentary rocks in the Kontum Massif and southern part of the Truong Son Belt, Indochina Block, central Vietnam to unravel the Precambrian episodes of the Indochina Block, if any. Two Triassic (meta)-sedimentary rocks reveal two significant age clusters of latest Carboniferous to Triassic (similar to 300-230 Ma) and Early Paleozoic (similar to 480-410 Ma), with the conspicuous lack of the 400-320 Ma zircon grains. Abundant Permian detrital zircon grains in Triassic metaquartzite from the Kontum Massif document that the subduction-related magmatism before the continental collision played an important role in the growth of the Kontum Massif. In contrast to these two (meta)-sedimentary rocks, the detrital zircon spectra of metaquartzite from the Kontum Massif show the most significant age peak of similar to 1780 Ma and abundant Archean zircon grains (16%). Furthermore, the oldest detrital zircon shows the Paleoarchean age (Pb-207/Pb-206 spot age of 3314 +/- 22 Ma). The metaquartzite was metamorphosed in the Early Paleozoic (similar to 414 Ma). The youngest detrital zircon grain yields the Pb-207/Pb-206 spot age of 1359 +/- 85 Ma. Hence, the approximate depositional timing of the protolith of metaquartzite was in Mesoproterozoic time. The newly obtained detrital zircon data indicate a significant contribution of the Paleoarchean to Paleoproterozoic crustal materials during the deposition of the quartzite in the Kontum Massif. The Kontum Massif had developed as a different unit in the Precambrian period from the Truong Son Belt as well as the southwestern Yangtze Block due to their different Precambrian provenance. This study reveals a new clue that the Kontum Massif was one of the Precambrian blocks in the Southeast Asian massifs.},

   abstract = {Understanding the development of the Central Asian Orogenic System (CAOS), which is the largest Phanerozoic accretionary orogen in the world, is critical to the determination of continental growth mechanisms and geological history of central Asia. A key to unraveling its geological history is to ascertain the origin and tectonic setting of the large flysch complexes that dominate the CAOS. These complexes have been variably interpreted as deep-marine deposits that were accreted onto a long-evolving arc against large continents to form a mega-accretionary complex or sediments trapped in back-arc to fore-arc basins within oceanic island-arc systems far from continents. To differentiate the above models we conducted U-Pb geochronological analyses of detrital-zircon grains from turbidites in the composite Hangay-Hentey basin of central Mongolia. This basin was divided by a Cenozoic fault system into the western and eastern sub-basins: the Hangay Basin in the west and Hentey basin in the east. This study focuses on the Hentey basin and indicates two groups of samples within this basin: (1) a southern group that were deposited after the earliest Carboniferous (similar to 339 Ma to 354 Ma) and a northern group that were deposited after the Cambrian to Neoproterozoic (similar to 504 Ma to 605 Ma). The samples from the northern part of the basin consistently contain Paleoproterozoic and Archean zircon grains that may have been derived from the Tuva-Mongol massif and/or the Siberian craton. In contrast, samples from the southern part of the basin contain only a minor component of early Paleozoic to Neoproterozoic zircon grains, which were derived from the crystalline basement bounding the Hangay-Hentey basin. Integrating all the age results from this study, we suggest that the Hangay-Hentey basin was developed between an island-are system with a Neoproterozoic basement in the south and an Andean continental-margin arc in the north. The initiation of the southern are occurred at or after the early Carboniferous, allowing accumulation of a flysch complex in a long-evolving accretionary complex. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

   abstract = {The establishment of robust Paleozoic tectonic links between parts of the Korean Peninsula and cratonic blocks within China remains uncertain, despite their important implications for the overall tectonic evolution of East Asia. Here we provide new SHRIMP U-Pb detrital zircon geochronological constraints on correlations between sedimentary rocks of the Taebaeksan Basin (Cambrian-Ordovician) of South Korea and possible source rocks in the North and South China cratons. The detrital grain compositions and whole-rock rare earth element (REE) compositions of sandstones from the Cambrian formations in western (Sambangsan) and eastern (Myeonsan) parts of the Taebaeksan Basin suggest that the sedimentary provenance of these two formations is either a recycled orogen or a magmatic arc. The magmatic (eastern part) versus metamorphic (western part) origins inferred for the youngest populations (ca. 0.5-0.6 Ga) of detrital zircon grains from the Cambrian formations collectively indicate that rapid uplift and erosion of the source rocks for the formations took place soon after the associated magmatic and metamorphic events. Thus, we propose that the paleo-sedimentary environments in which these two formations were deposited may have been retroarc basins with the detrital zircons originating from magmatic arcs. The Early Cambrian formation in the eastern Taebaeksan Basin contains populations of detrital zircon grains that show prominent age peaks at ca. 2.0 Ga and ca. 1.8 Ga, and a distinct lack of Meso- to Neoproterozoic ages, whereas the Middle Cambrian formation in the western Taebaeksan Basin exhibits age peaks at ca. 1.0 Ga and ca. 0.7 Ga. These age spectra imply that the western Taebaeksan area at the margin of the North China Block may once have been near Gondwana, whereas the eastern Taebaeksan area may have been situated at the margin of the North China Block more distant from Gondwana.

The age distributions of detrital zircons from different localities of Pennsylvanian strata in North China reflect varying contributions from the Inner Mongolia Paleo-uplift in the north and the Central China Orogenic Belt in the south. The supply of detritus from the northern source to distant areas, however, appears to have been limited during the Pennsylvanian times. The age distributions of detrital zircons from Korean Pennsylvanian strata located in the east of the SKB are characterized by a dense cluster of 1.84-1.90 Ga and differ from those of North China. The Korean age characteristic is best explained by strong influences of the detritus derived from the Paleoproterozoic Yeongnam Massif in southeastern Korea. Along with the significant number of zircons that record syn- to near-depositional magmatic activities, this observation supports the hypothesis of the existence of an active continental margin setting in the east of the SKB.},

   abstract = {The upper Palaeozoic succession (Pyeongan Supergroup) in central eastern Korea is well correlated with the equivalent successions distributed in North China, suggestive of the Korean upper Palaeozoic being part of the Sino-Korean Block. Detrital zircon U-Pb ages and Sm-Nd isotope compositions of the Pyeongan Supergroup in the Samcheok coalfield of the Taebaeksan Basin were analysed. A single predominant zircon age peak at c. 1.9 Ga (> 70%) is marked in all sedimentary units, followed by varying amounts of minor late Palaeozoic grains (up to 30%). The rarity of Meso- to Neoproterozoic- and Silurian-aged zircons confirms that sediment influx from the South China and Qinling blocks was insignificant. The 2.0-1.8 Ga-dominated zircon age pattern and the Nd isotope composition (average epsilon(Nd)(0) = -15.5 +/- 4.0) of the Pyeongan Supergroup most closely reflect the signature of the Yeongnam Massif basements, which supports a previous hypothesis that the Pyeongan Supergroup was mostly derived from a palaeo-orogen located to the east-southeast. Relatively higher epsilon(Nd)(0) values (> -10.1) in the lowermost and the upper parts of the succession are closely matched by the increased occurrence of syn-depositional-aged zircons, which indicates considerable mixing of juvenile materials at c. 320 Ma and 260 Ma. Both arc-related magmatic events are interpreted to have been related to oceanic subduction, suggesting that the eastern margin of the Sino-Korean Block was an active continental margin during late Palaeozoic times.},

It unconformably overlies the Paleoproterozoic Busan gneiss complex exposed as a small dome and is in contact with the Cambrian-Ordovician Joseon Supergroup of the Taebaeksan Basin to the east. We separated detrital zircons from the quartzite units of the Seochangni Formation and used SHRIMP and LA-MCICPMS to determine their U-Pb ages and Hf isotopic compositions. The U-Pb age distribution of the detrital zircons is divided into two types. In the main type, the ages of Late Paleoproterozoic to Mesoproterozoic are dominant, whereas they have little or no older age components of about 1.87Ga and 2.5Ga, which are characteristic of the Korean peninsula basement rocks. However, the minor type has age components of 0.75 Ga and 1.87 Ga. Age patterns similar to the former type have recently been reported in the western region of the Gyeonggi Massif on the Korean peninsula, as well as in the Sangwon System in North Korea and the southern margin of North China Craton. It suggests a correlation between them and a common crustal evolution within a single craton linked since the Paleoproterozoic. The high positive epsilon Hf(t) values of detrital zircons in the Late Paleoproterozoic to Mesoproterozoic period indicate an enhanced input of juvenile materials from the depleted mantle, reflecting the igneous activity associated with the breakup of the supercontinent Columbia.},

Here we report detailed detrital zircon U-Pb age data from the Neoproterozoic metasedimentary successions as well as geochemical data on the early Neoproterozoic rift-related plutonic rocks. Our results together with the available data from the central Korean Peninsula, lead to the following inferences. (1) Regional sedimentation in the early Neoproterozoic (ca. 1000-920 Ma) as a result of the late Paleoproterozoic to early Neoproterozoic intracratonic rifting. (2) Arc magmatism in the southern periphery of the central Korean Peninsula in the early Neoproterozoic (ca. 913-895 Ma and ca. 865-770 Ma). (3) Back-arc magmatism in the inland area of the central Korean Peninsula in the early Neoproterozoic (ca. 888-852 Ma). (4) Magmatism and sedimentation in the early Neoproterozoic (ca. 765-720 Ma) due to early Neoproterozoic back-arc and intracratonic rifting. The early-Neoproterozoic geological and tectonic events in the central Korean Peninsula correlate with those in the southeastern part of the North China Craton. The spatial and temporal similarities and discrepancies in the early Neoproterozoic geological records of the Sino-Korean continent mark the tectonic evolution within a continental inland (the southeastern part of the North China Craton) and a continental margin (the central Korean Peninsula).},

In this study, we present SHRIMP U-Pb ages of detrital zircon grains from the metasandstones of the Taean Formation and Yeoncheon Group of the Imjingang Belt and from quartzites in three Paleozoic formations of the southwestern Okcheon Belt. The zircon grains from all of the samples yielded similar U-Pb age spectra of Paleoarchean/Neoarchean to Middle Paleozoic, with a dominant age population within the Paleozoic. The maximum ages of deposition estimated from the youngest dominant concordant detrital zircons were 431-457 Ma for the western Gyeonggi Massif and Imjingang Belt, and 380-355 Ma for the southwestern Okcheon Belt. Permian metamorphic zircon overgrowths correlated with subduction prior to the Triassic collision were also found. Middle Paleozoic metamorphic zircon overgrowths that can be compared to those of the Yunkai-Wuishan Orogenic Belt of the Cathaysia Block were indentified in the Wolhyeonri Complex. The dominant zircon populations of this study and the available data for the Korean Peninsula compare well with those from the Yangtze Block, Cathaysia Block, and Qilian-Qinling Orogenic Belt, which were located at the northeastern margin of eastern Gondwana during the Early Paleozoic.

   abstract = {The southern part of the Korean Peninsula preserves important records of the Paleozoic evolutionary history of East Asia. Here we present SHRIMP U-Pb ages of detrital zircon grains from Paleozoic metasedimentary successions (Okcheon and Joseon Supergroups, Yeoncheon Group, Taean Formation, and Pyeongan Supergroup) that are incorporated into the major Phanerozoic mountain belts (Okcheon and Hongseong-Imjingang Belts) in South Korea, providing new insights for provenances and paleotectonic evolution of the South Korean Peninsula during Paleozoic time. The zircon ages from our samples display two distinct spectra patterns in their presence/absence of Neoproterozoic and/or Paleozoic populations. Our results, together with the available data from the Korean Peninsula, suggest that: (1) the Early to Middle Paleozoic successions in the Okcheon Belt were deposited in continental margin setting(s) formed by Neoproterozoic intracratonic rifting, (2) the Middle Paleozoic metasedimentary rocks in the Imjingang belt can be interpreted as molasse and flysch sediments along an active continental margin, (3) the Late Paleozoic to Early Triassic Taean Formation along the western Gyeonggi Massif represents a syn- to post-collision deltaic complex of a remnant oceanic basin, and (4) the Late Paleozoic to possibly Early Triassic Pyeongan Supergroup in the Okcheon Belt might represent a wedge-top and/or foreland basin. The spatial and temporal discrepancy between the South Korean Peninsula and the Central China Orogenic Belt during Paleozoic might reflect lateral variations in crustal evolution history along the East Asian continental margin during the Paleo-Tethyan Ocean closure.

   abstract = {The U-Pb isotopic compositions of zircon from a metasandstone cobble and a granitic dyke in Deokjeok Island, western Gyeonggi massif, Korea, were measured using a SHRIMP-II ion microprobe to constrain the depositional age of cobble-bearing metasedimentary strata. The metasandstone cobble, collected from a metaconglomerate of the slighltly-metamorphosed sedimentary unit (SMU), yielded 50 to 200 mu m long zircon crystals showing variable internal structures together with rounded corners. Sixty spots were analysed from 60 detrital crystals, including two spots of Permian metamorphic overgrowth dated at 255 +/- 4 Ma (1 sigma) and 263 +/- 4 Ma (1 sigma), respectively. Except for the Permian ages, their U-Pb age distribution pattern is characterized by a few major populations at similar to 400 Ma, similar to 1.0 Ga and similar to 2.5 Ga, and several minor peaks between 400 Ma and 2.5 Ga. This pattern is identical to that of the Devonian Taean Formation widespread along the western Gyeonggi massif. On the other hand, the similar to 260 Ma overgrowth age in the cobble could represent the zircon fraction formed in the sedimentary protolith of the cobble during the Permo-Triassic collisional orogeny. Zircon crystals from a granitic dyke intruding the SMU generally showed the oscillatory zonation, and yielded the weighted mean Pb-206/U-238 age of 225 +/- 3 (t sigma), corresponding to its intrusion age. It is thus likely that the cobble-bearing strata might have deposited during the Triassic prior to 225 Ma. Moreover, the SMU unit may represent post-orogenic sediementary strata filling the extensional basin developing along the suture at the western margin of the Gyeonggi massif.},

   abstract = {In the Early Jurassic, a large-scale transgression occurred on the South China continental margin (SCCM), affected by the initiation of Paleo-Pacific subduction. This transgression significantly influenced the source areas and transport mode of Lower Jurassic sediments in the SCCM. This study discussed the differences in the major source areas among the western, central, and eastern SCCM and constructed a brief Lower Jurassic sediments transport process in the SCCM. To avoid the bias of detrital-zircon ages caused by variations in zircon fertility, we gathered 1802 whole-rock zirconium content values (ppm) from representative granites with different ages in the South China Craton. Based on mean Zr contents and statistical analyses, we divided these granitic rocks into three groups: Group A consists of Jurassic (200-145 Ma) and Neoproterozoic (900-700 Ma), Group B consists of Paleozoic (490-390 Ma) and Permian-Triassic (280-210 Ma), and Group C comprised Paleoproterozoic (2000-1700 Ma) and Neoarchean (2900-2500 Ma). This research assigned these groups zircon fertility factors (ZFF) of 1.0, 1.4, and 2.5, respectively. Subsequently, by studying corrected detrital zircon ages from Lower Jurassic sediments by ZFF, we found that the Yunkai Terrane and Hainan Island were primary source areas for the western SCCM. The Wuyi Terrane and Nanling Tectonic Belt provided abundant detrital materials for the eastern SCCM. It should be noted that the central SCCM was a vast shallow sea in the Early Jurassic due to the large-scale transgression. Thus, the coastal currents and drowned pre-Jurassic river valleys controlled sediment delivery to the central SCCM. Overall, the Lower Jurassic sediments distribution system in the SCCM was significantly affected by Paleo-Pacific subduction.},

   abstract = {Recently, some scholars have proposed that the South China Block (SCB) was controlled by a compressive tectonic regime in the middle-late Early Cretaceous, challenging the belief that the SCB was under an extensional setting during the Cretaceous. The Early Cretaceous tectonic setting constraint in the SCB can offer vital insight to clarify the Mesozoic subduction history of the Paleo-Pacific. Therefore, to determine the SCB tectonic regime during the Early Cretaceous, this study investigated sedimentary rocks from the Lower Cretaceous Heshui Formation in the Xingning Basin, a foreland basin located in the southeastern SCB. Provenance analysis was performed using sandstone modal analysis, sandstone geochemical characteristics, and detrital zircon geochronology. Based on the results, we discussed basin sediment sources and the SCB tectonic regime during the Early Cretaceous. The results showed that the maximum Heshui Formation depositional age was 103 Ma +/- 1.6 Ma in the Early Cretaceous Albian. Detrital framework modes and geochemical characteristics of sandstone indicated that Heshui Formation's source rocks were granites and sedimentary rocks. The detrital zircon U-Pb ages could be classified into two major and four subordinate age populations. The Wuyi Terrane to the north and southeast coastal regions to the east were the primary potential Heshui Formation source areas. However, the lower and upper sandstones are different in the peak ages, similar to 437 and similar to 146 to 104 Ma, respectively, indicating that the major source area shifted from the Wuyi Terrane to the southeastern coastal regions during the late Early Cretaceous. The sandstone modal analysis results indicated that the source area comprised mainly collisional-orogenic material. The SCB was under a compressive tectonic regime during the late Early Cretaceous and this compression action continued until at least 103 Ma +/- 1.6 Ma.},

   abstract = {We performed U-Pb dating of detrital zircons and conducted petrological and whole-rock geochemical analyses to assess the provenance of the Upper Triassic - Lower Jurassic clastic rocks in the southeastern margin of the South China Block. Detrital zircon U-Pb ages are mainly classified into age groups of 2000-1700, 900-700, 490-390 and 280-210 Ma, consistent with derivation from the Jiangnan orogenic belt, Nanling Belt, as well as Wuyi and Yunkai domains. Lower Jurassic samples yield a special main age population of 200-190 Ma, and these detrital zircon grains have low Th/U and Nb/Hf ratios and high Th/Nb and Hf/Th ratios, showing they are derived from a continental magmatic arc. However, the cross-correlation and likeness coefficients of kernel density estimates of Upper Triassic and Lower Jurassic sandstones are 0.8608 and 0.8403, indicating that their populations are highly similar. Since the tectonic setting is the key factor in controlling the relationship between source and sink, the stable supply of identical provenance suggests that the tectonic setting did not significantly change during Late Triassic - Early Jurassic time. Sandstone petrography, regional facies distribution and the detrital zircon age patterns all reflect a consistent tectonic setting for the South China Block during Late Triassic - Early Jurassic time. The Palaeo-Pacific subduction therefore did not control the tectonic evolution of the South China Block until after the Early Jurassic Epoch.},

   abstract = {As the north-eastern margin of the North China Block, the Liaodong Peninsula has undergone multiple tectonic events during the Mesozoic, as well as simultaneous large-scale gold mineralization. In this study, we focus on the history of Early Cretaceous basin formation, during the interval of time prior to and during a major extensional tectonic event that is characterized by formation of metamorphic core complexes (MCCs), detachment faults, and half-graben basins. Two representative Early Cretaceous basins, the Tongyuanpu and Fangjiaweizi basins, expose two parts of the Xiaoling Formation (K(1)x); these two sequences, K(1)x(1) of the Tongyuanpu Basin and K(1)x(2) of the Fangjiaweizi Basin, were selected for detailed sedimentary and geochronological study. Both the K(1)x(1) and K(1)x(2) are dominated by sedimentary sequences of fluvial facies clastic rocks to volcani-clastic and volcanic rocks. Clastic and volcanic rock samples, including three samples from the K(1)x(1), four samples from K(1)x(2), and one mafic dyke sample, were analysed for U-Pb on zircon, to constrain the crystallization ages for volcanic units and maximum deposition age (MDA) for clastic units. The zircon U-Pb age results date the K(1)x(1) at 135-127 Ma, while the K(1)x(2) at 127-122 Ma. Comparing the detrital zircon age peaks with the main potential source areas, provenance of both the K(1)x(1) and K(1)x(2) units was mainly from igneous rocks in the Liaodong Peninsula. Integrating our observations from the Tongyuanpu and Fangjiaweizi basins with those from other basins in the Liaodong Peninsula, we suggest south-westward basin migration during the transition from transpressional basin formation to development of back-arc extension basin. This basin migration responded to the tectonic transition from sinistral strike-slip motion on the Tan-Lu Fault to the rollback of the Paleo-Pacific Plate coinciding with formation of MCCs. This tectonic transition and basin migration is important for understanding the transition from compression to extension in the eastern North China Block during the Early Cretaceous.},

   abstract = {Nima basin which is located in the Bangongco suture was surrounded by several thrust faults and its paleogeographical features and tectonic evolution process can be restored by the Paleogene sediments. Based on the methods of petrology, sedimentology, and zircon chronology, the features of provenance, paleogeography and tectonic activities of the Nima basin were analyzed through studying its Paleogene section. The compositional characteristics of sandstones, paleocurrent direction, and zircon U-Pb chronology indicate that the adjacent terranes and the thrust belts in the suture zone are the provenance areas for Nima basin. Qm-F-Lt, Qt-FL triangular diagram shows that the component of sandstones mainly belongs to the recycling orogenic zone, and indicates that the southern depression experienced intensive tectonic activities during the Paleogene period. Based on the characteristics of heavy minerals and sediments, the tectonic evolution of the south depression of Nima basin can be divided into four stages: the stable stage in Early Eocene, the strong active stage in Late Eocene, the highly stable stage in Early Oligocene, and the highly active stage in Late Oligocene. The collision between the Indian plate and Eurasian plate in the Early Cenozoic period led to the crustal shortening and uplifting of the Nima basin and the reactivating of the thrust fault system. The ancient river system which developed due to the uplift of the surrounding terrain and the strong tectonic orogeny provided debris deposits to the sedimentary center of the ancient lake, and therefore the coarse debris of fan delta develops on the edge of the steeper terrains of the lakes. The southern Nima basin eventually evolved into an independent sedimentary depression with multi-directional source and its paleogeography feature depended on the regional tectonic activity.},

It shows typically blocks-in-matrix structure with matrix of black shale and siliceous mudstone, and several centimeters to several meters sized blocks of sandstone, silicalite, limestone and basalt. The sandstone blocks consist of homologous sandstone and two types of exotic sandstone, with different modal compositions. The Group 1 of exotic sandstone blocks consists of mainly of feldspar and quartz, whereas the Group 2 is rich in volcanic detritus. The Group 3 of homologous sandstone blocks is rich in feldspar and volcanic detritus with rare occurrence of quartz. U-Pb age data and in situ Hf isotopic compositions of detrital zircons from sandstone blocks are similar to those from the Lhasa terrane, suggesting that the sandstone blocks in the Gajia m,lange most probably came from the Lhasa terrane. The YC1 sigma(2+) age of homologous sandstone blocks is 177 +/- 2.4 Ma, suggesting an Early Jurassic depositional age for the sandstones within the Gajia m,lange.

   abstract = {The uplift of Tibet Plateau and the marginal sea spreading have had important influence on the tectonic, landform and drainage system in East Asia, although the marginal sea spreading in shaping the topography and drainage reorganization in East Asia has been still controversial. Here we present U-Pb age and Hf isotopic composition of detrital zircon grains from Cenozoic sedimentary rocks in Taiwan to understand how the provenance and river systems evolved. Our data show that the U-Pb age spectra of detrital zircon grains in Paleogene sandstones are dominated by Yanshanian (180-67 Ma) zircon grains and with subordinate or nil Proterozoic and Archean zircon grains. These results are in contrast to those in Miocene rocks that are dominated by the Indosinian (257-205 Ma) zircon grains together with Yanshanian, Proterozoic and Archean population. The initial Hf isotope ratios [epsilon Hf(t)] of the zircon grains also display systematic change in Paleogene and Neogene strata. Our data demonstrate that the Hsuehshan Range and Western Foothills in Taiwan have the same sedimentary sources. The source region of Paleogene strata was mainly located at the coast in southeast China and migrated inland over time. The source might have reached the Lower Yangtze region during early Miocene. Although the mechanism of transport of sediments from the Lower Yangtze region to Taiwan is unclear, we speculate that the Minjiang River might have been larger in Early Miocene than the present and might have delivered inland material along the boundary of Yangtze and Cathaysia Blocks to Taiwan. These were then captured by the Yangtze River systems at some time after Late Miocene. This change corresponds to the time of the drainage reorganization in East Tibet, such as Yangtze River, and the regional subsidence resulting from the opening of marginal sea. The combined effects of Tibet uplift and opening of marginal sea might have shaped the topography and river system reorganization in East Tibet. The evolution of topography and drainage systems in southeast China seems to be mainly controlled by the opening of marginal sea. (C) 2015 International Association for Gondwana Research.

   abstract = {At the eastern terminus of the Himalayan orogen, distortion and capture of southeast Asian drainage basins reflects regional patterns of crustal strain due to the indentation of the Indian Plate into Eurasia. After flowing eastward >1000 km along the southern margin of Tibet, the Yarlung-Siang-Brahmaputra River turns abruptly southward through the eastern Himalayan syntaxis rapidly exhuming a crustal scale antiform in an impressive >2 km knickpoint. This conspicuous drainage pattern and coincidence of focused fluvial incision and rapid rock exhumation has been explained by the capture of an ancestral, high-elevation Yarlung River by headward erosion of a Himalayan tributary. However, recent observation of Tibetan detritus in Neogene foreland basin units complicates this explanation, requiring a connection from Tibet to the foreland prior to the estimated onset of rapid rock exhumation. We constrain the sedimentary provenance of foreland basin units deposited near the Brahmaputra River confluence in the eastern Himalayan foreland basin using detrital zircon U-Pb geochronology. We interpret the significant presence of Gangdese-age detritus in each foreland basin unit to indicate that connection of the YarlungSiang-Brahmaputra River was established during, or prior to foreland deposition in the Early Miocene. Our results indicate that connection of the Yarlung-Siang-Brahmaputra River precedes exhumation of the syntaxis, demonstrating the potential for the progressive coevolution of rock uplift and rapid erosion of the Namche Barwa massif.

This new information provides important evidence to constrain the tectonic evolution of the southern Lhasa subterrane during the Late Triassic - Jurassic period. The sandstones are exposed in the lower and upper sections of the Xiongcun Formation. Their average modal abundance (Q(21)F(11)L(68)) classifies them as lithic arenite, which is also supported by geochemical studies. The high chemical index of alteration values (77.19-85.36, mean 79.96) and chemical index of weathering values (86.19-95.59, mean 89.98) of the sandstones imply moderate to intensive weathering of the source rock. Discrimination diagrams based on modal abundance, geochemistry and certain elemental ratios indicate that felsic and intermediate igneous rocks constitute the source rocks, probably with a magmatic arc provenance. The detrital zircon ages (161-243 Ma) and epsilon(Hf)(t) values (+10.5 to +16.2) further constrain the sandstone provenance as subduction-related Triassic-Jurassic felsic and intermediate igneous rocks from the southern Lhasa subterrane. A tectonic discrimination method based on geochemical data of the sandstones, as well as detrital zircon ages from sandstones, reveals that the sandstones were most likely deposited in an oceanic island-arc setting. These results support the hypothesis that the tectonic background of the southern Lhasa subterrane was an oceanic island-arc setting, rather than a continental island-arc setting, during the Late Triassic - Jurassic period.},

   abstract = {The mechanisms for crustal thickening and exhumation along the Yarlung (IndiaAsia) suture in southern Tibet are under debate, because the magnitudes, relative timing, and interaction between the two dominant structures-the Great Counter thrust and Gangdese thrust-are largely unconstrained. In this study, we present new geologic mapping results from the Yarlung suture zone in the Lazi region, located similar to 350 km west of the city of Lhasa, along with new igneous (5 samples) and detrital (5 samples, 474 ages) U-Pb geochronology data to constrain the crystallization ages of Jurassic- Paleocene Gangdese arc rocks, the provenance of Tethyan Himalayan and Oligocene-Miocene Kailas Formation strata, and the minimum age (ca. 10 Ma) of the Great Counter thrust system. We supplement these data with a compilation of 124 previously published thermochronologic ages from Gangdese batholith, Kailas Formation, and Liuqu Formation rocks, revealing a dominance of 23-15 Ma cooling contemporaneous with slip across the Great Counter thrust system and other potentially linked structures. These data are systematically younger than 98 additional compiled thermochronologic ages from the northern Lhasa terrane, recording mainly Eocene cooling. Structural and thermochronologic data were combined with regional geological constraints, including International Deep Profiling of Tibet and the Himalaya (INDEPTH) seismic reflection data, to develop a new structural model for the Oligocene-Miocene evolution of the Tethyan Himalaya, Yarlung suture zone, and southern Lhasa terrane. We propose that a hinterland-dipping duplex beneath the Gangdese mountains, of which the Gangdese thrust is a component, is kinematically linked with a foreland-dipping passive roof duplex along the Yarlung suture zone, the Great Counter thrust system. The spatial and temporal convergence between the proposed duplex structures along the Yarlung suture zone and the South Tibetan detachment system indicate that they may be kinematically linked, though this relationship is not directly addressed in this study. Our interpretation, referred to as the Gangdese culmination model, explains why the Gangdese thrust system is only locally exposed (at relatively deeper structural levels) and provides a structural explanation for early Miocene crustal thickening along the Yarlung suture zone, relief generation along the modern Gangdese Mountains, early Miocene Yarlung River establishment, and creation of the modern internal drainage boundary along the southern Tibetan Plateau. The progression of deformation along the suture zone is consistent with tectonic models that implicate subduction dynamics as the dominant control on crustal deformation.},

Geologic mapping, 14 detrital U-Pb zircon (n=1895 ages), 11 igneous U-Pb zircon, and nine zircon (U-Th)/He samples reveal the structure, age, provenance, and time-temperature histories of Lopu Range rocks. A hornblende-plagioclase-epidote paragneiss block in ophiolitic melange, deposited during Middle Jurassic time, records Late Jurassic or Early Cretaceous subduction initiation followed by Early Cretaceous fore-arc extension. A depositional contact between fore-arc strata (maximum depositional age 971Ma) and ophiolitic melange indicates that the ophiolites were in a suprasubduction zone position prior to Late Cretaceous time. Five Gangdese arc granitoids that intrude subduction-accretion melange yield U-Pb ages between 49 and 37Ma, recording Eocene southward trench migration after collision initiation. The south dipping Great Counter Thrust system cuts older suture zone structures, placing fore-arc strata on the Kailas Formation, and sedimentary-matrix melange on fore-arc strata during early Miocene time. The north-south, range-bounding Lopukangri and Rujiao faults comprise a horst that cuts the Great Counter Thrust system, recording the early Miocene (similar to 16Ma) transition from north-south contraction to orogen-parallel (E-W) extension. Five early Miocene (17-15Ma) U-Pb ages from leucogranite dikes and plutons record crustal melting during extension onset. Seven zircon (U-Th)/He ages from the horst block record 12-6Ma tectonic exhumation. JurassicEocene Yarlung suture zone tectonics, characterized by alternating episodes of contraction and extension, can be explained by cycles of slab rollback, breakoff, and shallow underthrustingsuggesting that subduction dynamics controlled deformation.},

The modern Lhasa River catchment contains the requisite sources, and its main trunk transects the Gangdese magmatic arc, joining with the Yarlung River at a barbed junction at the India-Asia suture. We infer that the Lhasa River is an ancient feature that transported sediment to the subduction zone in Late Cretaceous time and persisted during India-Asia collision.},

Here we explore the limits of spatial resolution and stratigraphic sensitivity of detrital zircon in ascertaining provenance, and we demonstrate its ability to detect source changes for terranes separated by only a few tens of kilometers. For such an analysis to succeed for a given mountain, discrete intrarange source terranes must have unique U/Pb zircon age signatures and sediments eroded from the range must have well-defined depositional ages. Here we use similar to 1400 single-grain U/Pb zircon ages from northeastern Tibet to identify and analyze an area that satisfies these conditions. This analysis shows that the edges of intermontane basins are stratigraphically sensitive to discrete, punctuated changes in local source terranes. By tracking eroding rock units chronologically through the stratigraphic record, this sensitivity permits the detection of the differential rock uplift and progressive erosion that began ca. 8 Ma in the Laji Shan, a 10-25-km-wide range in northeastern Tibet with a unique U/Pb age signature.},

   abstract = {Sedimentary rocks in Tibetan Plateau basins archive the spatiotemporal patterns of deformation, erosion, and associated climate change that resulted from Cenozoic continental collision. Despite growing understanding of basin development in northeastern Tibet during initial India-Asia collision, as well as in the late Miocene-Holocene, surprisingly little is known about the intervening period: a time when the plateau may have undergone fundamental tectonic changes. To fill this gap, we present new magnetostratigraphy from a > 2300-m-thick fluviolacustrine succession that spans ca. 30-9.3 Ma. An integrated analysis of sedimentology, subsidence, and provenance from this section reveals the sequential, pulsed erosion of multiple ranges bordering the Xunhua Basin. Emergence of the WNW-trending Laji Shan is highlighted by a doubling of sediment accumulation rates between 24 and 21 Ma and a transition to coarse alluvial facies at 20.3 Ma. Detrital zircon U/Pb age spectra show that these coarse sediments came from basement terranes within the Laji Shan. Together these observations suggest accelerated growth of the Laji Shan and its coupled foreland basin at ca. 22 Ma. The most rapid accumulation rates in Xunhua Basin occur within the finest-grained strata and suggest an underfilled basin during the fastest interval of Laji Shan deformation. Growth of the Laji Shan occurred northward of the contemporaneous plateau margin, which had been defined since ca. 45-50 Ma by the West Qinling, lying similar to 60 km farther south. Hence, following similar to 20-25 m.y. of apparent stability, the deformation front in this region jumped similar to 60 km to the north at ca. 22 Ma. Subsequently, growth of the north-trending Jishi Shan occurred at ca. 13 Ma and is highlighted by an acceleration in Xunhua Basin accumulation rates between 12 and 9 Ma, as well as by a significant change in detrital zircon provenance of nearby Linxia Basin deposits by 11.5 Ma. Initial growth of the WNW-trending Laji Shan in the early Miocene and subsequent growth of the north-trending Jishi Shan similar to 10 m.y. later support interpretations of a middle Miocene kinematic reorganization in northeastern Tibet.},

   abstract = {The Cambrian-Ordovician Taebaeksan Basin overlies the Precambrian basement of the Sino-Korean Block (North China Craton) in the central-eastern Korean peninsula. This corresponds to the occurrence of the global marine transgression over the Great Unconformity in the Cambrian, which is widely recognized. However, the palaeogeography of the Sino-Korean Block during the Early Cambrian-Ordovician remains unclear. This study aimed to identify the provenances and reconstruct the palaeogeography of the eastern Sino-Korean Block. For this purpose, we investigated U-Pb ages of detrital zircons in the lower Cambrian-Ordovician successions using samples collected from the Danyang (i.e. Jangsan), Jeongseon, and Dongjeom areas. Detrital zircons from all samples clearly exhibited predominant clusters of Paleoproterozoic ages (ca. 1875-1861 Ma) and a minor cluster of Neoarchean ages (ca. 2500 Ma). The age spectra from the lower quartzites (Jangsan and Jeongseon formations) are partly distinguished from those in the Taebaeksan Basin, showing bimodal Precambrian peaks, which indicates the preferred drainage system within the Sino-Korean Block. A lack of young detrital zircon ages representing maximum depositional ages in the lower quartzites indicates that there were little igneous activity and little influx of external detritus. The age spectra from the lower quartzites, in contrast, are different from those of the conformably overlying shale (i.e. similar to 510 Ma Myobong Formation) consisting mainly of Neo-Mesoproterozoic detrital zircons derived from East Gondwana. Paleoproterozoic detrital zircons in the upper quartzite (Dongjeom Formation) were repetitively predominant without Neoproterozoic detrital zircons. The reappearance of predominant Paleoproterozoic zircons is most likely associated with uplifts possibly due to the subduction of the Paleo-Asian Ocean (PAO). We suggest that progressive changes along the eastern margin of the Sino-Korean Block were affected by the regional tectonism, regardless of the global transgression during the Cambrian-earliest Ordovician (ca. 480-500 Ma).},

The Lower Cretaceous successions of the Gyeongsang Basin are coevally correlated to those of the Cretaceous Gunsan Basin in the Yellow Sea which is located far to the west of the Gyeongsang Basin. This study presents U-Pb ages of detrital zircons to evaluate the sediment provenances of the Gyeongsang Basin. The detrital zircon ages clearly show the different distributions between the northern (Uiseong area) and southern (Jinju area) areas of the Gyeongsang Basin. The detrital zircons of the northern area have an age cluster in the Jurassic or Triassic, whereas the detrital zircons of the southern area show a wide range of ages from early Cretaceous to Neoarchean. In the Gunsan Basin, detrital zircons from a core also yield ages ranging from early Cretaceous to Neoarchean. The age distribution from the Gunsan Basin is similar to those of the southern Gyeongsang Basin, except for the absence of Jurassic detrital zircons. The petrographic modal analysis of sandstones in the Gyeongsang Basin suggests a mixed provenance. This study indicates that possible sediment provenances of the Gyeongsang Basin were shared with those of the Gunsan Basin. We suggest that the sediment provenance of the northern Gyeongsang Basin was adjacent basement highs, whereas sediments to the southern Gyeongsang Basin were probably derived from relatively distant source areas that possibly were located in the vicinity of the Gunsan Basin during the early Cretaceous (ca. 113 Ma).

   abstract = {The western Korean Peninsula preserves evidence for multiple Proterozoic to Phanerozoic orogenic processes along the convergent continental margins. After the Late Palaeozoic to Early Mesozoic collisional stage within the long-lived tectonic Wilson cycles, the area underwent post-collisional extensional tectonics, creating the Late Triassic to Early Jurassic basins on top of the collisional orogenic belt. Here, we present the LA-MC-ICP-MS U-Pb ages of detrital zircons and bulk-rock geochemical data from post-collisional basin fills (viz., the Nampo and Gimpo groups and the Seokmun Formation) and the overlying volcano-sedimentary sequence (Oseosan Volcanic Complex). Our results suggest that (1) the Nampo Group was supplied with detritus mainly from nearby felsic igneous rocks or geochemically equivalent migmatitic basement gneisses, while the Gimpo Group and Seokmun Formation were predominantly sourced from (meta-)sedimentary rocks, likely reflecting their structural positions in the orogenic belt in terms of the exhumed basement-dominant hinterland side vs. the cover rock-dominant foreland side of the mountain belt; (2) the ages of the youngest zircon group in the Nampo Group and the overlying Oseosan Volcanic Complex (ca. 1854 age peak in the lowermost unit and ca. 164 Ma age peak in the uppermost unit) tend to approach the sedimentation ages with ascending stratigraphic order, indicating a transition from a collisional to a convergent tectonic setting during sedimentation. The results from this study provides important insights into the sedimentary response to the evolution of the collisional orogenic belt along the western Korean Peninsula and elucidates the Mesozoic tectonic transition from collisional (closure of the Paleo-Tethys Ocean) to convergent (subduction of the Paleo-Pacific Ocean) processes in the Far East Asian continental margin.},

A coeval unconformity in the Sino-Korean Block has recently been documented from several different areas of China; however, the stratigraphic position of this boundary in the eastern margin of the Sino-Korean Block in the Taebaek Group, central-eastern Korea, is still elusive. We present an integrated approach incorporating detailed field observations, sedimentary petrography, and detrital zircon geochronology on the basal stratigraphic units of the Taebaek Group (Jangsan, Myeonsan, and Myobong formations) to resolve this issue. In contrast to the traditional view that all three formations are of early Cambrian age, that the Myeonsan Formation is a lateral equivalent of the Jangsan Formation, and that the Myobong Formation conformably overlies the other two formations, our data indicate that the Myeonsan Formation can be a lateral equivalent of the basal Myobong Formation. We propose that the Great Unconformity possibly lies between the Jangsan and Myeonsan/Myobong formations: the Jangsan Formation is probably of Precambrian age, and the Myeonsan and Myobong formations are early Cambrian in age. This result suggests that the Great Unconformity on the Sino-Korean Block extends to the eastern margin of the block in the Korean Peninsula. The recognition of the Great Unconformity in the Taebaek Group will help to clarify the stratigraphic correlation, tectonic history, and paleogeographic reconstruction of the eastern Sino-Korean Block during the Cambrian.},

SHRIMP and LA-MC-ICPMS U-Pb analyses were performed on the detrital zircons separated from the constituent formations of the Gyeongsang Basin. We determined the maximum depositional ages of the four formations based on their ages of the youngest groups as follows; 118.0 +/- 2.6 Ma (n = 4) for the Hasandong Formation, 108.7 +/- 0.8 Ma (n = 11) for the Chilgok Formation, 106.0 +/- 0.2 Ma (n = 63) for the Silla Conglomerate, 105.4 +/- 0.4 Ma (n = 14) for the Haman Formation, and 99.9 +/- 0.7 Ma (n = 5) for the Jindong Formation, belonging to the period from Aptian to Cenomanian. The pre-Cretaceous detrital zircons of the lower to middle Gyeongsang Supergroup indicate their derivation from the Yeongnam Massif and the Okcheon Metamorphic Belt surrounding the Gyeongsang Basin. At around 115 Ma, as reflected as enhanced proportion of such ages in the detrital zircons and occurrence of farther inland igneous activities, the tectonic environment of Gyeongsang Basin changed to intra-arc due to the more active reestablishment of subduction-related igneous activity. However, the upper Gyeongsang Supergroup has a new age component of the mid-Permian, along with changes in the direction of paleocurrent flowing from the northeast and east, indicating sediment supply from SW Japan with rocks of that age. The changes in the direction of the paleocurrent flow seem to indicate that the center of igneous activity has moved in the direction of the subduction zone to the east. As the intensity of igneous activity continued to increase, the Gyeongsang Basin was closed by the filling of the basin by volcanic activity. The Cretaceous basins of the Korean Peninsula and southwest Japan show similar evolutionary histories, suggesting a type model of the creation and the evolution of basin around the continental margin subduction zone; creation of sedimentary basin by pull-apart or rifting in the backarc region, evolution to intra-arc basin by the landward progress of subduction-related igneous activity, and finally the closure of the basin due to the advent of highly enhanced igneous activity.},

The provenance of the southern Nakdong Formation is dominantly the surrounding Yeongnam Massif, which is composed of Paleoproterozoic metamorphic rocks and Triassic to Jurassic plutonic rocks, whereas the central to northern Nakdong Formation records significant sediment derivation from the Okcheon Metamorphic Belt, which is distributed to the northwest, in addition to the contribution from the Yeongnam Massif. It is suggested that the maximum depositional age of the Nakdong Formation is ca 127Ma, based on its youngest detrital zircon age population. The onset of its deposition at 127Ma coincided with the tectonic inversion in East Asia from a compressional to an extensional geodynamic setting, probably due to the contemporaneous change in the drift direction of the Izanagi Plate and its subsequent oblique subduction.},

The detrital zircon U-Pb ages of the Myogok Formation show a wide range from Archean to Cretaceous and yield four main clusters at age intervals of 130-150 Ma, 170-220 Ma, 221-320 Ma and Paleoproterozoic. Such age clusters indicate that the main provenance rock types during the sedimentation were basement rocks of the Yeongnam massif and the Mesozoic granitoids distributed around the Myogok Formation. The concordia age of the youngest population is 138.6 +/- 2.1 Ma (n = 7), indicating the possible maximum deposition age for the Myogok Formation. Considering the suggestion of probable deposition of Nakdong Formation during the Barremian (Lee et al., 2012), the Valanginian or Hauterivian seems to be the most appropriate timing for the deposition of the Myogok Formation. The last activity of the Daebo orogeny might be constrained to Hauterivian or Barremian considering some time lag needed for basin closure and deformation that followed. The measured epsilon(Hf)(t) values from the detrital zircons of the Myogok Formation vary from -25.7 to 4.8. However, most of the zircons, even those with Mesozoic ages, show negative values except a few, implying dominant influence of old continental crusts in the generation of their igneous protoliths.},

   abstract = {The Jangsan Formation distributed in the Taebaeksan Basin, central eastern Korea is unfossiliferous and is composed of quartz arenite. This formation is conventionally believed to be the lowermost stratigraphic unit of the lower Paleozoic sequence deposited on the Yeongnam massif in South Korea, corresponding to Early Cambrian in age. U-Pb dating of detrital zircon grains using a laser ablation inductively coupled mass spectrometer yields ages ranging from Archean to Middle Proterozoic (1738 +/- 67 Ma to 3058 +/- 53 Ma). Detrital zircons show no ages younger than 1.8 Ga, suggesting that the Jangsan Formation was deposited at some time after this age, but much prior to ca. 520 Ma, the depositional age of the immediately overlying Myobong Formation. This interpretation is supported by the recent report on the presence of the unconformity between the Jangsan and the Myobong formations (Kim and Lee, 2006). Zircon ages from Jangsan sandstones define two major groups: Archean-age grains with a maximum frequency at about 2.5 Ga and Paleoproterozoic-age grains with maximum frequencies at about 2.1 and 1.8 Ga. The observed zircon age distribution in the Jangsan sandstones may represent that of the Yeongnam massif on which the Jangsan Formation was deposited. Such an age distribution of the Yeongnam massif matches well with that the North China block, suggestive of the Yeongnam massif being a part of the Sino-Korean craton during the Precambrian.

   abstract = {The northern Qilian Shan, located along the northeastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau, experienced multiple phases of orogeny throughout the Phanerozoic, culminating in fold-thrust and strike-slip deformation associated with the Cenozoic India-Asia collision. Earlier phases of deformation in the Qilian Shan have been severely reactivated or transformed by the most recent Cenozoic strain. To better understand the tectonic evolution of this complex region, we conducted an integrated investigation of field observations, U-Pb dating of igneous and detrital zircons, and a synthesis of previously published data to constrain and reconstruct the pre-Cenozoic history of the northern Qilian Shan. This effort reveals five major age populations important to the history of this region: 2550-2350, 1850-1750, 1050-950, 500-435, and 320-240 Ma. Using this dataset, we identified three major depositional shifts and/or variations in drainage patterns that affected sediment provenance of the northern Qilian Orogen. Observed regional geologic constraints, the magmatic history, and new geophysical observations of the deep structure allow us to propose a coherent tectonic model for the pre-Cenozoic evolution of the northeastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau. (1) Late Neoproterozoic to Cambrian rifting opened the Qilian Ocean. (2) Early Cambrian subduction initiation along the margins of Qaidam and North China-Tarim continents resulted in Cambrian-Ordovician bivergent subduction, arc magmatism within these two continents, and consumption of the Qilian Ocean. (3) Final ocean closure and continental collision occurred at ca. 440 Ma and was associated with syn- and post-orogenic magmatism. (4) Collisional orogeny variably eroded the basement rocks, reorganized drainage networks, and altered sedimentary provenance for the lower Paleozoic to upper Paleozoic deposits. (5) Mesozoic extension led to the development of thick Jurassic-Cretaceous terrestrial basins. This pre-Cenozoic history resulted in preexisting weaknesses and/or low-friction detachment horizons that played a decisive role in controlling the pattern, distribution, and timing of Cenozoic deformation across the northern Tibetan Plateau.},

   abstract = {Because of the limited magmatic and metamorphic record, the Late Paleozoic tectonic setting in South China remains controversial. This paper presents sedimentologic data and provenance analysis of Upper Paleozoic sandstones in Longyan, which are rich in quartz (73-90%) and poor in lithic fragments (2-12%) and feldspar (3-25%). Devonian sandstones contain mostly metamorphic lithic fragments (e.g., quartzite), whereas Carboniferous-Permian sandstones contain mostly felsic volcanic and subvolcanic lithic fragments indicating provenance from felsic volcanic rocks. Detrital zircon U-Pb age spectra of Devonian-Carboniferous sandstones display modes at similar to 440 Ma and 420-380 Ma, with subordinate Mesoproterozoic age components, pointing at the Nanling terrane and the western-middle part of the Wuyi terrane as most likely ultimate sediment sources. Permian sandstones inherited the age components mentioned above, but also include peaks at similar to 290 Ma and similar to 1850 Ma. The similar to 290 Ma component corresponds to the age of Late Paleozoic magmatism in southeastern China and southwest Japan. Numerous detrital zircons aged at 350-250 Ma also occur in Permo-Triassic strata exposed across South China and southwest Japan. Based on regional data and on the ages and Hf isotope signatures of detrital zircon, we infer that a Late Paleozoic continental arc existed in the coastal area of southeastern China and contributed detritus to the adjacent sedimentary basins. The Permo-Triassic igneous rocks locally exposed in the area may represent the remnant of that continental arc. Arc growth may have been responsible for the westward retreat of a broad Upper Paleozoic carbonate platform.},

   abstract = {The Bangong-Nujiang Suture Zone (BNSZ), located in the central Tibetan Plateau, experienced a Late Mesozoic transition from oceanic closure to continent-continent collision. Based on sandstone-composition analyses, U-Pb detrital-zircon dating and structural observations, we determined that this transition occurred coeval with the accretion of the Lhasa Terrane to Eurasia. According to our newly observed stratigraphic and geochronological data, we conclude the following: (1) the Upper Triassic-Lower Jurassic Muggar Gangri Group was mainly derived from the Qiangtang Terrane; (2) the Shamuluo Formation composed of Upper Jurassic-Lower Cretaceous shallow marine strata was sourced from both the Qiangtang Terrane and recycled Muggar Gangri Group; (3) the Lower Cretaceous (similar to 125-110 Ma) Duoni Formation shows both Lhasa and Qiangtang detrital zircon fingerprints, indicating closure of the Bangong-Nujiang Ocean at similar to 120 Ma; and (4) the Upper Cretaceous Abushan Formation is a suite of intramontane molasse deposited after the Qiangtang-Lhasa collision. Therefore, these sedimentary strata record the transition from oceanic closure to continent-continent collision from 125 to 90 Ma within the central BNSZ. Moreover, based on relationships among strata distributions and thrust locations, we propose that thrust movements propagated southward during this transition and controlled sedimentary basin deposition. The Late Mesozoic tectonic transition within the BNSZ occurred well before the India-Asia collision and hence profoundly influenced the Cenozoic formation of the Tibetan Plateau.},

   abstract = {The paleoposition of North China Craton in Rodinia has long been in controversial. This paper mainly focuses on the U-Pb geochronological studies of detrital zircons obtained from Bayan Obo Group exposed in the Shangdu area, Inner Mongolia, aiming to provide more information for interprating this problem. Based on the acquired data, this paper comes to the following conclusions. Firstly, the depositional age of Bayan Obo Group might be from Meso- to Neoproterozoic according to the zircons U-Pb dating results. The lower succession of this group, namely Dulahala and Jianshan formations deposited between 1800 and 1650 Ma. The Halahuogete and Bilute formations deposited between 1500 and 1350 Ma. For Baiyinbaolage and Hujiertu formations, their depositional age was 1250-900 Ma. Secondly, for the provenance of Bayan Obo Group, this paper believes detrital zircons with age of 2.51-2.71 Ga and 2.00-2.48 Ga were from Guyang, Xi Ulanbulang and Zhuozi area; the Khondalite Belt provided detrital zircons with age of 1.95-1.80 Ga; zircons with age of 1.60-1.75 Ga might come from granitic rocks in Miyun Area. The magmatism after 1.60 Ga was rarely recorded in the NCC, therefore those zircons with ages younger than 1.60 Ga might come from outside of NCC. The magmatism with the same age existed in Baltic, Amazonia and Laurentia. Based on previous paleomagnetic researches, this paper proposes that NCC might receive detritus from Baltic during 1560-1350 Ma and had affinity with Laurentia and Amazonia at similar to 0.9 Ga in Rodinia. Baltic, Amazonia and Laurentia might be potential provenances for non-NCC detritus in Bayan Obo Group.},

   abstract = {Tectonic activity and climate change are regarded as two important driving forces on the evolution of large-scale drainage. The evolution of the Irtysh River and Ulungu River, two large-scale drainage systems in the northern Junggar Basin, can provide a key constraint on the uplift of the Altai Mountains and Central Asian aridification. However, we know little about the evolution of these two large-scale rivers. This study presents new detrital zircon U-Pb data from the late Oligocene to late Miocene sedimentary sequences and modern river sediments to reconstruct Cenozoic paleo-drainage evolution in the northern Junggar Basin. The detrital zircon U Pb results show a single major population at 460-360 Ma, which is mainly derived from the Altai Mountains, for late Oligocene and early Miocene sequences, but two populations at 460-360 Ma and 340-200 Ma, which are mainly from the Altai Mountains and East Junggar terrane, for middle and late Miocene sequences. Our provenance study argues that the Irtysh River and Ulungu River in their modern extent did not exist prior similar to 18 Ma when the Altai Mountains allowed southward-flowing rivers to transport sediments into the inner Junggar Basin directly. The provenance shift in northern Junggar Basin at 17-18 Ma represents the progressive drainage expansion of the Ulungu River, evolving from relatively small rivers confined to the eastern Junggar Basin to a near-modern large-scale drainage system, due to the rapid uplift in the East Junggar terrane and eastern Altai Mountains in early Miocene. After similar to 6 Ma, the Irtysh River experienced a progressive drainage expansion, captured the southward-flowing tributaries of the Ulungu River and formed modern drainage pattern. Our study supports the initiation of exhumation before late Oligocene and a local tectonic uplift in early Miocene in Altai Mountains, which imply a complex deformation process in the Central Asia.},

Cambrian to Jurassic (meta-) sedimentary strata and their metamorphic counterparts were well preserved in the eastern part of the Baoshan block. Zircon U-Pb dating, trace elements, and Hf isotope data for both the Cambrian to Jurassic (meta-) sedimentary sequences and the Lincang granite were used to deduce the provenance of sediments and crustal affinity with eastern Gondwanaland. The Lincang granite outcropped in the Fengqing area is typical S-type, with crystallization age of similar to 230 Ma and narrow range of zircon epsilon(Hf)(t) values from -15.5 to -10. Detrital zircons from Paleozoic strata range in age from Archean to early Paleozoic, with age peaks at similar to 2.5, similar to 0.95, and similar to 0.6 Ga. Triassic age peak (similar to 230 Ma) was also detected in the Jurassic strata. Detrital zircon epsilon(Hf)(t) values exhibit a wide range from negative to positive for each of the four major age groups, showing the host magma of zircons from these groups have diverse sources. The Baoshan block should be along the Indian margin as the Qiangtang, Tengchong and Simao-Indochina blocks in Early Paleozoic based on the provenance analyses. Sediment inputs eroded from both the Lincang granite and the coeval igneous rocks in the Baoshan and Gongshan blocks were the dominant contributions to the Jurassic strata after the amalgation of the Baoshan and Simao-Indochina blocks. Tectonic processes linking dispersion of the Baoshan-Sibumasu terrane from the Gondwana supercontinent to the collision with the Simao-Indochina block and the deposition of the Cambrian to Jurassic sedimentary sequences were reconstructed.

Three granites intruded into the Tengchong block at similar to 72 Ma, similar to 114 Ma and similar to 122 Ma.

Some studies have suggested that continental subduction occurred in central Qiangtang, but there is a lack of definitive evidence. Thus, the role of continental subduction in the formation and evolution of the central Qiangtang melange belt has not been fully considered. We therefore studied the origin and structural evolution of the central Qiangtang melange belt. Detrital zircon research indicates that the continental blocks in the Gangma Co melange are part of the Carboniferous-Permian strata of the South Qiangtang terrane and have a Gondwanan affinity. Structural studies and geologic observations in the Gangma Co area show a change in the structural style and a pressure difference between the lower melange and the upper Carboniferous-Permian strata. Structures in the Gangma Co melange include D1 layer-parallel ductile structures, D2 horizontal contractional structures, D3 flattening structures, and D4 slightly horizontal contractional structures. According to our analysis, the newly proposed in situ continental subduction model best explain these findings. [GRAPHICS] .},

Studies of zircon U-Pb ages and Hf isotopic compositions show that four elastic sedimentary rock samples from different parts of the regional stratigraphic sequence were deposited at different ages, none earlier than Mid- or Early Silurian. Two sedimentary rocks were deposited during or after the Early Permian. Almost all zircons are of igneous origin. In Silurian and Devonian sediments, zircons show several modal age peaks, and in Permian sediments, zircons show a unimodal age peak. Based on the zircon age distribution of sedimentary rocks versus known ages from exposed rocks of the potential source regions, most of the zircons were derived from the Xing-Meng Orogen itself. A few came from the South Mongolian microcontinent or the Siberia Block, but none came from the North China Block. The zircons of a biotite-plagioclase paragneiss in Xilinhot have similar provenance to the sediments and were deposited during or after the Middle Devonian. Similarities between zircon age spectra and events in underlying rocks of sedimentary origin show that the sediments lie at their deposition site north of the Solonker suture zone because north-dipping subduction and elevation blocked deposition of material from farther afield. Hf isotope compositions show the crustal accretion stages of the provenance areas during the Meso- to Neoarchaean. Palaeoproterozoic and Early and Late Palaeozoic. A two-component mixing calculation based on Hf isotopes shows the large scale of the crustal accretion event of the region. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

   abstract = {Marine sedimentary rocks of the Tethyan Himalayan sequence exposed south of the India-Asia suture and north of the high Himalayan mountain belt are widely attributed to India's passive margin along the southern margin of the Neo-Tethys ocean. The focus of this study are the Tethyan sequence strata exposed in southern Tibet that yield U-Pb detrital zircon age probability spectra and epsilon Hf values that are in stark contrast with Tethyan sequence strata of known Indian affinity. The rocks of the Upper Triassic Songre and Nieru Formations, exposed <10 km south of the India-Asia suture, yield populations of U-Pb zircon ages in the range of similar to 450-220 Ma. Detrital zircon crystals of this age are not known to populate India affinity Tethyan sequence strata. The youngest cluster of ages, in the range of similar to 266-224 Ma, typically have juvenile epsilon(Hf(T)) values (+5.5-+13.5). Zircon ages and epsilon(Hf(T)) values in this range are consistent with igneous rocks of the Lhasa terrane on the northern margin of the Neo-Tethys ocean during Triassic time or with a hypothesized juvenile arc source from within the Neo-Tethys ocean. Collectively these unexpected results highlight the current uncertainties over the nature Neo-Tethys ocean and tectonic setting of the southern Lhasa prior to the India-Asia collision. We propose that the Upper Triassic age northern Tethyan Himalayan strata studied here represent an independent terrane from the widely studied southern Tethyan Himalayan strata. These rocks where isolated from the southern Tethyan Himalayan strata during Late Triassic time. This isolation was the result of a bathymetric barrier within the Neo-Tethys ocean such as a spreading center or an inter-Tethys arc system. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

In this article, we report field and petrographic observations, in situ detrital zircon U-Pb ages, Lu-Hf isotopic analyses, and Cr-spinel electron microprobe data from the Upper Cretaceous to Lower Tertiary sedimentary rocks of the Renbu melange zone in east Xigaze, southern Tibet. The Renbu melange zone consists of two serpentinite melange subzones separated by a mud-matrix melange. Using similarities found in the compositions of detrital Cr-spinels and detrital zircon U-Pb ages, we propose to correlate the northern Renbu melange subzone with the upper part of the Xigaze forearc basin. Detrital zircons from sandstones in the southern Renbu melange subzone indicate an influx of Cretaceous-early Cenozoic zircon grains with juvenile Hf isotopic compositions, suggesting a provenance from the Lhasa terrane, especially the Gangdese arc. Compared to the melange in the western Xigaze, our new results show that much younger sediments were deposited on the top of the accretionary wedge, with the youngest U-Pb age cluster including six single grains in the range of 64-53 Ma and a large peak at 67 Ma. Our results support the idea that the foreland basin developed along the Indus-Yarlung suture during the India-Asia collision.},

We report new data relevant to the provenance of a Late Triassic clastic sequence from the Mailonggang Formation in the central Lhasa terrane, Tibet. Petrographic studies and detrital heavy mineral assemblages indicate a proximal orogenic provenance, including volcanic, sedimentary and some ultramafic and metamorphic rocks. In situ detrital zircon Hf and U-Pb isotope data are consistent with derivation of these rocks from nearby Triassic magmatic rocks and basement that comprise part of the newly recognized Late Permian-Triassic Sumdo-Cuogen orogenic belt. The new data suggests correlation with the Upper Triassic Langjiexue Group which lies on the opposing (southern) side of Indus-Yarlung ophiolite.

   abstract = {The composite fore-arc/syncollisional Xigaze basin in south Tibet preserves a key record of India-Asia collision. New apatite fission track and zircon (U-Th)/He data from an N-S transect across the preserved fore-arc basin sequence near Xigaze show a consistent northward Late Cretaceous to middle Miocene younging trend, while coexisting apatite (U-Th-Sm)/He ages are all Miocene. Corresponding detrital zircon U-Pb data are also reported for constraining the Cretaceous depositional ages of the Xigaze basin sequence in the region. Thermal history modeling indicates that the basin experienced northward propagating episodic exhumation, along with a northward migration of the depocenter and a pre-existing Cenozoic syncollisional basin sequence which had been removed. In the southern part, fore-arc exhumation commenced in the Late Cretaceous (similar to 892Ma). Following transition to a syncollisional basin in the Paleocene, sedimentation in the central and northern Xigaze basin continued until the latest Eocene (similar to 344Ma). Ongoing folding and thrusting (e.g., Great Counter Thrusts) caused by progressive plate convergence during late Oligocene-early Miocene time resulted in regional uplift and considerable basin denudation, which fed two fluvial basins along its northern and southern flanks and exposed the basement ophiolite. Subsequent incision of the Yarlung River resulted in Miocene cooling in the region. Different episodes in the exhumation history of the Xigaze basin, caused by thrusting of an accretionary wedge and ophiolitic basement, can be linked to changes in India-Asia convergence rates and the changing subduction pattern of the Indian and Neo-Tethyan slabs.},

   abstract = {The eastern margin of the Jiamusi Block records the tectonic transition from a passive to an active continental margin during the Late Paleozoic- Early Mesozoic. Late Paleozoic sedimentary rocks from the Heitai and Zhenzishan formations along the eastern margin of the Jiamusi Block are a key to resolving these events. Major and trace element data (including REE) for 18 samples from late Paleozoic sedimentary rocks, with the characteristics of high SiO2, Al2O3, Na2O and K2O, low CaO, MgO and TiO2, enrichment in LREE and LILE, depletion in HFSE, and negative Eu anomalies, were plotted on various discrimination diagrams, indicating that the Heitai Formation formed in a passive continental margin setting, whereas the Zhenzishan Formation formed in an active continental margin setting. LA-ICPMS U-Pb dating of detrital zircon from two samples of the Heitai Formation and two samples from the Zhenzishan Formation indicates a range in age from 2735 +/- 19 to 308 +/- 3 Ma, showing similar populations to the Jiamusi Block. These detrital zircons not only indicate that the sedimentary material was derived from the Jiamusi Block, but also limit the depositional ages of the Heitai and Zhenzishan formations. The youngest zircon population of 374-384 Ma, with a peak at 382 Ma, from the Heitai Formation, together with evidence from paleontological studies, indicates the depositionol age of the Heitai Formation is Devonian (Givetian- Famennian), whereas the 308-318 Ma population, with a peak at 315 Ma, from the Zhenzishan Formation indicates that the depositionol age was late Carboniferous (post- Moscovian). This indicates that the transition from a passive to an active continental margin in the Jiamusi Block occurred between the Late Devonian and the late Carboniferous (380-310Ma) and was more likely related to the Mongol Okhotsk oceanic subduction-accretion or Panthalassa Ocean, and not to the Paleo-Pacific Ocean or to the Paleo-Asian Ocean as previous considered.},

   abstract = {The Lower Yangtze foreland basin is situated to the northwest of the early Palaeozoic Wuyi-Yunkai orogen in South China. To demonstrate its provenance history and the denudation of the orogen, seven sandstone samples were collected from the upper Ordovician to Silurian strata for U-Pb dating. The zircons show a broad range of ages that can be linked with the ages of specific units in the Wuyi-Yunkai orogen. The zircon spectra in the late Ordovician samples are similar to those in the pre-orogenic strata, suggesting a recycled source. The dominant age population of 880-740 Ma in the early Llandovery samples indicates that the middle Neoproterozoic volcanic rocks were the primary source. A significant age population of 460-425 Ma in the late Llandovery to Wenlock samples reflects the fact that the synorogenic magmatic and metamorphic rocks were exposed to provide detritus. The youngest zircons from the uppermost Silurian strata yield an age of 425 Ma, which approximates the inferred depositional age. This age, together with available biostratigraphic data, indicates that the foreland basin was formed 448-425 Ma ago. We surmise a possible link between the Wuyi-Yunkai orogen and the Appalachian-Caledonian orogen based on the geological constraints and palaeomagnetic data.},

Detrital Zircons from these two basins fall into three major groups based on their U-Pb ages: Phanerozoic, Paleoproterozoic, and Neoarchean. The youngest grain from every sample is only slightly younger than the real depositional age of strata. The Phanerozoic zircons from the Jiyuan basin (244-390 Ma) show epsilon(Hf)(t) ranging from -30.3 to -1.3, suggesting a provenance from the Inner Mongolia Paleo-uplift (245-376 Ma, epsilon(Hf)(t) = -18.9 to -1.7). A bi-modal distribution of ages and epsilon(Hf)(t) is noted for detrital zircons from the Ordos basin; one resembles that of the Jiyuan basin, the other is characterized by Early Paleozoic ages and relatively high epsilon(Hf)(t) values (-10.9 to 7.7). A hybrid source is thus inferred for the Ordos sediments; the Northern Qinling Orogen (428-478 Ma, epsilon(Hf)(t) = -10.9-7.7) must have served as a source in addition to the Inner Mongolia Paleo-uplift source. This interpretation is consistent with the fact that the Northern Qinling Orogen was an active margin during the Early Paleozoic and suggests that the western part of the Northern Qinling Orogen was elevated relative to the center of the craton during the Late Paleozoic. It is likely that the Early Paleozoic arc-trench in the northern part of the Dabie Orogen was under-thrusted below the NCC due to the subduction of the Yangtze plate during the Triassic. The Inner Mongolia Paleo-uplift was strongly uplifted by subduction of the Paleo-Asian Ocean Plate underneath the northern NCC and functioned as a sediment source for the inner craton during the Late Paleozoic. These results reveal a heterogeneous pattern of destruction of the North China Craton, with its northern margin starting to be activated no later than Late Paleozoic. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

   abstract = {This paper reports U-Pb-Hf isotopes of detrital zircons from Late Triassic-Jurassic sediments in the Ordos, Ningwu, and Jiyuan basins in the western-central North China Craton (NCC), with the aim of constraining the paleogeographic evolution of the NCC during the Late Triassic-Jurassic. The early Late Triassic samples have three groups of detrital zircons (238-363 Ma, 1.5-2.1 Ga, and 2.2-2.6 Ga), while the latest Late Triassic and Jurassic samples contain four groups of detrital zircons (154-397 Ma, 414-511 Ma, 1.6-2.0 Ga, and 2.2-2.6 Ga). The Precambrian zircons in the Late Triassic-Jurassic samples were sourced from the basement rocks and pre-Late Triassic sediments in the NCC. But the initial source for the 238-363 Ma zircons in the early Late Triassic samples is the Yinshan-Yanshan Orogenic Belt (YYOB), consistent with their negative zircon epsilon(Hf)(t) values (-24 to -2). For the latest Late Triassic and Jurassic samples, the initial source for the 414-511 Ma zircons with epsilon(Hf)(t) values of -18 to +9 is the Northern Qinling Orogen (NQO), and that for the 154-397 Ma zircons with epsilon(Hf)(t) values of -25 to +12 is the YYOB and the southeastern Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB). In combination with previous data of late Paleozoic-Early Triassic sediments in the western-central NCC and Permian-Jurassic sediments in the eastern NCC, this study reveals two shifts in detrital source from the late Paleozoic to Jurassic. In the Late Permian-Early Triassic, the western-central NCC received detritus from the YYOB, southeastern CAOB and NQO. However, in the early Late Triassic, detritus from the CAOB and NQO were sparse in basins located in the western-central NCC, especially in the Yan'an area of the Ordos Basin. We interpret such a shift of detrital source as result of the uplift of the eastern NCC in the Late Triassic. In the latest Late Triassic-Jurassic, the southeastern CAOB and the NQO restarted to be source regions for basins in the western-central NCC, as well as for basins in the eastern NCC. The second shift in detrital source suggests elevation of the orogens surrounding the NCC and subsidence of the eastern NCC in the Jurassic, arguing against the presence of a paleo-plateau in the eastern NCC at that time. It would be subsidence rather than elevation of the eastern NCC in the Jurassic, due to roll-back of the subducted paleo-Pacific plate and consequent upwelling of asthenospheric mantle.

Four major groups of U-Pb ages (namely, 3.0-2.3 Ga, 2.2-1.4 Ga, 1250-430 Ma and 410-150 Ma) are recognized for zircons from the fine-grained sandstones. The post-Paleoproterozoic zircons of the Late Permian sample show an age cluster of 344-255 Ma with epsilon(Hf)(t) values of -18 to -8, being similar to those extracted from Late Paleozoic igneous rocks from the Yinshan-Yanshan Orogenic Belt (YYOB) on the northern margin of the NCC. However, the Devonian-Jurassic zircons (390-150 Ma) from the Jurassic sediments have epsilon(Hf)(t) values from -45 to +14, very similar to the mixture of Phanerozoic zircons from the Xing-Meng Orogenic Belt (XMOB) and the YYOB, but significantly different from those of the Liaodong Peninsula, Jiaodong Peninsula and the Western Shandong Uplift. In addition, Cambrian-Silurian zircons (535-430 Ma) of the Jurassic samples have epsilon(Hf)(t) values from -27 to +7, resembling the Early Paleozoic zircons extracted from the Northern Qinling Orogen (NQO). The U-Pb age spectra and Hf isotope of Devonian-Jurassic zircons as well as bulk Nd isotopes suggest that the central eastern NCC received some juvenile materials from the XMOB, the YYOB and the NQO during the Jurassic. This indicates widespread prototype basins and a low elevation during the Jurassic, arguing against the presence of a paleo-plateau in the eastern NCC at that time. The lack of evidence predicted by lithospheric delamination (e.g., large-scale elevation or doming after Late Triassic) makes the delamination unlikely to be a viable mechanism of lithospheric thinning of the NCC The subsidence rather than elevation of the eastern NCC after Late Triassic might be related to thermo-chemical erosion of the lithosphere by underlying convective mantle in a back-arc setting.

Detrital zircons laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-1CP-MS) U-Pb ages from two samples, together with paleocurrent directions and clastic composition in the Xishuigou section demonstrate that sediments in the Subei basin originated from the Danghenanshan range along its southern margin. Detrital zircons U-Pb ages from three samples in the Xiaobiegai basin, together with paleocurrent directions and clastic composition, indicate that sediments in the Xiaobiegai basin may partly originate from terranes along the northeastern margin of the basin in addition to the Danghenanshan range. Our results, combined with regional evolution, suggest that the Xiaobiegai and the Subei basins was a combined basin in Oligocene-early Miocene. This basin was folded, tilted, and dislocated at ca. 8 Ma by rapid uplift of the northern Tibetan plateau and rapid strike-slip of the ATF. As a result, the Subei basin became a thrust-fold belt of the Danghenanshan range front, and the Xiaobiegai basin grew into an intermontane basin in the northeastern part of the Danghenanshan range. Thus, the Subei area gradually acquired its present morphotectonic patterns. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The Wuguan Complex, distributed along the southern margin of the Shangdan suture zone, can provide important constraints on the age of collision between NCB and SCB and the tectonic evolution of the Qinling orogen in Late Paleozoic. Detrital zircons from meta-sedimentary rocks of the Wuguan Complex in the Danfeng-Shangnan area have an age spectrum with two main peaks at similar to 448 Ma and similar to 819 Ma, and two subordinate peaks at similar to 938 and similar to 1440 Ma, respectively, and are interpreted to have been derived from the North Qinling terrane (NQT). The petrographic and geochemical characteristics of the meta-sedimentary rocks indicate that they were deposited in a fore-arc basin along the southern margin of the NQT. The youngest detrital zircons yield a weighted mean age of 378 +/- 3 Ma, indicating that the fore-arc deposition was continuing at least to this time, which implies that the Paleo-Qinling Ocean between the NCB and SCB was not finally closed until at least the late Devonian. In combination with regional data, we propose that sedimentary rocks of the Wuguan Complex might once have been a sequence of late Ordovician to late Devonian strata with intercalated mafic rocks, which has been dismembered by the later tectonic activity. It was metamorphosed during northward subduction of the Paleo-Qinling Ocean at ca. 320 Ma, and slowly cooled through ca. 350 degrees C at ca. 247 Ma (muscovite Ar-40/Ar-39 age).

   abstract = {There is a wide support that the Inner Mongolia Palaeo-uplift on the northern margin of the North China Craton has undergone an uplifting history. However, when and how did the uplift occurred keeps controversial. Extensive field-based structural, metamorphic, geochemical, geochronological and geophysical investigations on the Inner Mongolia Palaeo-uplift, which suggested that the Inner Mongolia Palaeo-uplift was an uplifted region since the Early Precambrian or range from Late Carboniferous-Early Jurassic. The geochemical characteristics of the Late Paleozoic to Early Mesozoic intrusive rocks indicated that the Inner Mongolia Palaeo-uplift was an Andean-type continental margin that is the extensional tectonic setting. To address the spatial and temporal development of the Inner Mongolia Palaeo-uplift, we have carried out provenance analysis of Permian sedimentary rocks which collected from the Panyangshan basin along the northern margin of the North China Craton. The QFL diagram revealed a dissected arc-recycled orogenic tectonic setting. Moreover, the framework grains are abundant with feldspar (36-50%), indicating the short transport distance and unstable tectonic setting. Detrital zircon U-Pb analysis ascertained possible provenance information: the Precambrian basement (similar to 2490 and (similar to 1840 Ma) and continental arc magmatic action ((similar to 279 and (similar to 295 Ma) along the northern margin of the North China Craton. The projection in rose diagrams of the mean palaeocurrent direction, revealing the SSW and SSE palaeoflow direction, also shows the provenance of the Panyangshan basin sources mainly from the Inner Mongolia Palaeo-uplift. The andesite overlying the Naobaogou Formation has yielded U-Pb age of 277.3 +/- 1.4 Ma. The additional dioritic porphyry dike intruded the Naobaogou and Laowopu Formations, which has an emplacement age of 236 +/- 1 Ma. The above data identify that the basin formed ranges from Early Permian to Middle Triassic (277-236 Ma). Accordingly, the Inner Mongolia Palaeo-uplift also was developed in the Early Permian to Middle Triassic (277-236 Ma), related to the final closure of the Paleo-Asian Ocean. Furthermore, we advocate that the tectonic setting of Inner Mongolia Palaeo-uplift probably belonged to the plate marginal orogenic belt during Early Permian-Middle Triassic.},

   abstract = {The amalgamation of South China Block and its role in the assembly and breakup of Rodinia supercontinent have been hotly debated in recent decades. However, the intensity of accreted arcs around South China and the following exhumation were poorly constrained. Here we present combined U-Pb dating and Hf isotopic analyses of detrital zircons for a stratigraphic section of the upper Shuangqiaoshan Group in the eastern part of the Jiangnan Orogen (JO). U Pb dating results suggest a general younging trend of the maximum depositional ages from the Anlelin to the Xiushui Formations of the upper Shuangqiaoshan Group, indicating a co-magmatic sedimentation in association with continental-arc magmatism along the SE margin of the Yangtze Block. The Anlelin and Xiushui Formations were constrained to form in the periods of ca. 845-836 Ma and ca. 835-815 Ma, respectively. Provenance analysis suggests two sources for these Neoproterozoic basement sequences. Neoproterozoic zircons with positive-epsilon Hf(t) values represent detritus derived from the arc-related magmatic rocks to the southeast, whereas >1000 Ma zircons and the other Neoproterozoic detrital zircons with negative epsilon Hf(t) values are proposed to be sourced from the interior of the Yangtze Block to the northwest. Simultaneously, the Hf isotope results of detrital zircons indicate that there was a rhythmic source change for the sediments in the upper Shuanggiaoshan Group, with the amounts of two separate sources from the Yangtze Block to the west and from the arc terranes to the east increasing alternatively. This provides solid evidence for a bidirectional water flow and supports a back-arc basin setting for the deposition of the sediments. Combined with the published U Pb and Hf isotopic data for detrital zircons from the Neoproterozoic folded sedimentary sequences in the JO, we calculated the relative contribution of arc-derived crustal materials in the basement sequences of the JO. The calculations suggest that the proportion increases progressively from west to east and the back-arc basins represented by the folded sedimentary sequences could be divided into three regions, plus an arc terrane region to the east. This comparison further suggests that the orientation of Neoproterozoic accretion on the Southeastern margin of the Yangtze Block was in a W-E direction, and the JO in Neoproterozoic may not have extended 1500 km as what we see today.

Here, we report LA-ICP-MS detrital zircon U-Pb-Hf isotopes from four metamorphic clastic rock samples in the Huashan Group. Detrital zircons ages yield four major peaks at ca. 2,670, 2,040, 940, and 840 Ma and five subordinate peaks at greater than or equal to ca. 2,850, 2,490, 1,840, 1,600, and 1,240 Ma. The provenance of the Huashan Group includes Archean to mid-Neoproterozoic magmatic rocks, and reworked sedimentary rocks from the northern Yangtze Block. The Huashan Group was deposited from ca. 830 to 800 Ma and represents sedimentation accompanying the development of a mid-Neoproterozoic continental rift basin in Yangtze Block associated with the breakup of the Rodinia supercontinent. Hafnium isotope analyses of detrital zircon from the Huashan Group suggest that most crustal growth in the northern Yangtze Block occurred during the Late-Mesoproterozoic and early to Middle Neoproterozoic and crustal reworking occurred from the Archean to the Neoproterozoic.},

   abstract = {Our limited knowledge of Mesozoic tectonism in the Tibetan Plateau has hindered understanding of its geologic evolution. This study uses zircon U-Pb geochronology to refine regional chronostratigraphy and infer the Jurassic sedimentary-tectonic evolution of the Bangong suture and the south-central Qiangtang terrane in the central plateau. During the late Early-early Middle Jurassic, fan delta and alluvial fan deposits sourced from the Amdo basement to the south occurred within the Amdo suture zone, as a result of collision between the Amdo basement and Qiangtang terrane. Since the Bajocian of the Middle Jurassic, continued sea-level rise transformed the Qiangtang terrane into a south-facing shallow continental shelf, and sedimentary detritus was predominantly sourced from the Hoh Xil and Kunlun terranes to the north. The contemporaneous magmatic arc in southern Qiangtang terrane was most likely submerged in a marine setting and did not contribute much detritus to the Middle Jurassic strata. Starting from the early Late Jurassic, a depositional hiatus occurred in the southern Qiangtang terrane, whereas the shallow marine to deltaic deposition in the central Qiangtang terrane received detritus not only from the Hoh Xil and Kunlun terranes to the north, but also from the magmatic arc in southern Qiangtang terrane to the south. The arrival of abundant Jurassic arc-derived detritus in central Qiangtang terrane since ca. 163 Ma was most likely caused by the early Late Jurassic initial collision between the Lhasa and Qiangtang terranes, which raised the southern Qiangtang magmatic arc to be a source region.},

   abstract = {The Hoh Xil Basin in the central Tibetan Plateau was the locus of thick accumulation of terrestrial sediments from the Late Cretaceous to Neogene, providing an archive of regional tectonic activity both before and after initiation of the early Paleogene India-Asia collision. This work focuses on the stratigraphy and provenance of the poorly studied western part of the Hoh Xil Basin. Lithostratigraphy, carbonate oxygen isotopic composition, and deformation features suggest that the braided river and alluvial-fan that dominated the Kangtuo Formation in the southern West Hoh Xil subbasin can be correlated with the Late Cretaceous-early Eocene Fenghuoshan Group deposits of the East Hoh Xil subbasin, whereas deltaic, shallow lacustrine, and evaporite strata of the Suonahu Formation in the central-northern West Hoh Xil subbasin can be correlated to the middle Eocene-early Oligocene-Yaxicuo Formation of the East Hoh Xil subbasin. These observations suggest that the eastern and western parts of Hoh Xil Basin evolved as a unified basin during Late Cretaceous-Oligocene time. Detrital zircon U-Pb ages indicate that the Kangtuo Formation and Feng-huoshan Group mainly received detritus from the Qiangtang terrane to the south, whereas the age probability distributions of the Suonahu Formation and Yaxicuo Formation sandstones are more similar to zircon ages reported for the northern Qiangtang terrane and within the Hoh Xil terrane. We favor a tectonic model with Late Cretaceous-early Eocene contractional deformation and topographic growth of the south-central Qiangtang terrane that caused flexural subsidence of the south-central Hoh Xil region within a retroarc foreland basin, relative to the Tanggula thrusts in central Qiangtang. Following the onset of India-Asia collision, the locus of contractional deformation moved northward, marked by activity of the Fenghuoshan and Hoh Xil thrust systems within the Hoh Xil region, and resulting in transformation of the Hoh Xil foreland basin to a hinter-land basin. We suggest that both middle Eocene to late Oligocene upper-crustal shortening and associated thickening of the lower crust and mantle lithosphere as well as late Oligocene to Miocene loss of dense mantle lithosphere contributed to the topographic growth of the Hoh Xil Basin.},

   abstract = {The "Great Unconformity" across the Proterozoic-Phanerozoic boundary has long been recognised as critical for understandings of the Cambrian Explosion and changes in sediment preservation. However in many parts of the Earth no rock strata are preserved for hundreds of millions of years leading up to the Cambrian Period. This study reports detrital zircon age and whole rock geochemical data from 43 samples of glaciogenic rocks in the Ediacaran Luoquan and Dongpo Formations. Detrital zircon age populations show a distinct peak at ca. 2.5 Ga and minor peaks at 2.2-1.6 Ga, typical of Mesoproterozoic provenance. It has been established that glaciogenic strata are uniquely suited as a proxy for the average upper continental crust (UCC). Applying this principle, the samples presented herein are used to provide insights into the UCC present in the North China Craton (NCC) during the Great Unconformity. This reveals UCC older than the Neoproterozoic but younger than the Great Oxygenation Event. Based upon these findings a tectonic and climatic model is proposed, using a modern analogue from Antarctica, wherein accommodation space was created by glacial abrasion whilst uplift continued throughout the NCC. This overdeepening process provides an explanation for the preservation of these glaciogenic strata, despite the Great Unconformity that surrounds them on all sides and this study contribute towards understanding of processes in the NCC during a critical time when little has survived into the rock record.},

   abstract = {The Taihua Complex is an important metamorphic rock suite at the southern margin of the Trans-North China Orogen and hosts important mineral deposits. Its protolith and metamorphic ages are still controversial. The 1.85-Ga Longmendian Mo deposit in the Xiong'ershan is hosted by the khondalite series of the Duangou Formation, Taihua Complex. Three kinds of rocks are collected for SHRIMP/CAMECA U-Pb dating, including the meta-sedimentary rock that occurred as wallrock, the Mo-mineralized meta-gabbro that intruded the meta-sedimentary rock, and the leucosome that cut both the meta-sedimentary rock and the meta-gabbro. Zircon U-Pb analyses reveal that the precursor of the meta-sedimentary rock was crystallized between 2200 +/- 4 and 2742 +/- 18 Ma (with most before 2500 Ma), whereas the protolith of the meta-gabbro was formed at 2178 +/- 6 Ma. Anatexis zircons in the leucosome yield a weighted mean age of 1943 +/- 8 Ma that is indistinguishable with the metamorphic age of the meta-gabbro (1952 +/- 4 Ma). In the intensively altered meta-gabbro, hydrothermal titanites were formed by at least two pulses of crystallization at 1940 +/- 7 Ma and 1916 +/- 9 Ma, respectively. The new data reveal that the khondalite series of the Duangou Formation were formed between 2200 Ma and 2178 Ma. The results are inconsistent with previous subdivision of the Taihua Complex into the Upper Taihua and Lower Taihua Subgroup. Instead, they fit well with the tripartitite divison into the Beizi Group (3.0-2.55 Ga), the Dangzehe Group (2.55-2.3 Ga) and the Shuidigou Group (2.3-2.1 Ga). Compiling zircon U-Pb ages indicate that in the Trans-North China Orogen, the 1.95 Ga and 1.85 Ga metamorphic events are widespread and prominent. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {The NW-SE Irtysh Shear Zone is a major tectonic boundary in the Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB), which supposedly records the amalgamation history between the pen-Siberian orogenic system and the Kazakhstan/south Mongolia orogenic system. However, the tectonic evolution of the Irtysh Shear Zone is not fully understood. Here we present new structural and geochronological data, which together with other constraints on the timing of deformation suggests that the Irtysh Shear Zone was subjected to three phases of deformation in the late Paleozoic. D-1 is locally recognized as folded foliations in low strain areas and as an internal fabric within garnet porphyroblasts. D-2 is represented by a shallowly dipping fabric and related similar to NW-SE stretching lineations oriented sub-parallel to the strike of the orogen. D2 foliations are folded by similar to NW-SE folds (F-3) that are bounded by a series of mylonite zones with evidence for sinistral/reverse kinematics. These fold and shear structures are kinematically compatible, and thus interpreted to result from a transpressional deformation phase (D-3). Two samples of mica schists yielded youngest detrital zircon peaks at similar to 322 Ma, placing a maximum constraint on the timing of D-1-D-3 deformation. A similar to NE-SW granitic dyke swarm (similar to 252 Ma) crosscuts D-3 fold structures and mylonitic fabrics in the central part of the shear zone, but is displaced by a mylonite zone that represents the southern boundary of the Irtysh Shear Zone. This observation indicates that the major phase of D-3 transpressional deformation took place prior to similar to 252 Ma, although later phases of reactivation in the Mesozoic and Cenozoic are likely. The late Paleozoic deformation (D-1-D-3 at similar to 322-252 Ma) overlaps in time with the collision between the Chinese Altai and the intra-oceanic arc system of the East Junggar. We therefore interpret that three episodes of late Paleozoic deformation represent orogenic thickening (D-1), collapse (D-2), and transpressional deformation (D3) during the convergence between the Chinese Altai and the East Junggar. On a larger scale, late Paleozoic sinistral shearing (D3), together with dextral shearing farther south, accommodated the eastward migration of internal segments of the western CAOB, possibly associated with the amalgamation of multiple arc systems and continental blocks during the late Paleozoic.

   abstract = {The largest accretionary orogen in the world, the Central Asian orogenic belt, has evolved through the assembly of various oceanic and continental blocks. Understanding the processes associated with the development of this orogenic belt relies on precise recognition of the boundaries between various terranes. One such major suture zone, which records the collisional history of the Siberian marginal arc system (Chinese Altai) with intra-oceanic arc systems (East/ West Junggar), is the Irtysh shear zone in NW China. The spatial continuity and the tectonic nature of this shear zone are still poorly under-stood, but its development has supposedly made a significant impact on the architecture of the western Central Asian orogenic belt and the formation of the Kazakhstan orocline. Here, we provide new insight into the evolution of this shear zone based on detrital zircon ages, Hf isotope composition, structural data and Ar-40/Ar-39 age constraints on the timing of deformation. Our results show a major discrepancy in detrital zircon populations and Hf model ages across the southern Chinese Altai and the northern East/ West Junggar, thus allowing us to map the exact location of the tectonic boundary. Detrital zircon data constrain the initial closure of the Ob-Zaisan Ocean to the late Carboniferous (<323 Ma), and new structural and Ar-40/Ar-39 geochronological data shed light on the subsequent collisional processes. We propose that the collisional zone between the Chinese Altai and the East/West Junggar was initially subjected to crustal thickening at ca. 323-295 Ma, followed by orogen-parallel extension (ca. 295 Ma) and transpressional deformation (ca. 286-253 Ma). The closure of the Ob-Zaisan Ocean in NW China postdates the initial phase of oroclinal bending in the western Central Asian orogenic belt, thus indi-cat-ing that oroclinal bending initiated during subduction. Based on our new constraints and other available geological data, we suggest that the early stage of oroclinal bending was likely driven by slab rollback.},

In order to understand the Paleogeography of the Eastern Paleo-Tethys, a systematic U-Pb dating on 11 samples have conducted to constrain the age and provenance of the elements forming the Ailaoshan-Song Ma me ' lange. These samples consist of the ophiolitic me ' lange zone (6 samples), the sedimentary cover of the Indochina block (4 samples), and the post-orogenic continental deposits (1 samples). The achieved detrital zircon age distribution, and the corresponding in-situ Hf isotopic recorder allow us to discuss the provenances of the materials involved in the tectonic processes during the subduction and collision. Three units (M1, M2, M3), which stand for the different segment of the suture zone, could be separated based on the differences in zircon age clusters and Hf isotopic values. These differences might be due to the variety of provenances. Combined with the previous works, especially our work on the Song Chay melange zone, we concluded that both upper and lower plates are potential provenances for the me ' langes between South China block and Indochina block. Along the suture zone, the component of the me ' lange presents a significant heterogeneity.},

   abstract = {Geochemical data reveal the contrasting geochemical characteristics of the metasediments in the Jiepailiang and Bizigou formations of the Palaeoproterozoic Zhongtiao Group, North China Craton. High Zr/Sc and SiO2/Al2O3 values and especially the evolved and uniform nature of epsilon(Nd)(t) values plus detrital zircon U-Pb ages and Hf isotopic signatures for the former are consistent with derivation from an evolved felsic source with sedimentary recycling signs. However, lower values of SiO2/Al2O3 and Zr/Sc, and higher contents of Fe2O3* and MgO for the latter indicate input of more mafic components. These geochemical characteristics, combined with the wide range of epsilon(Nd)(t) values, suggest that these rocks were derived in part from old continental material, dominated by felsic rocks of magmatic origin, and in part from a continental island arc, which accounts for the variable mixture of mafic components. These results suggest that the Zhongtiao Group was deposited after c. 2110 Ma, in a back- arc basin, behind an eastward- directed subduction system. Subsequent deformation and metamorphism reflect closure of the oceanic basin between the Eastern and Western blocks of the North China Craton, along the Trans- North China Orogen, contributing to amalgamation of the supercontinental Columbia.},

   abstract = {A suite of slightly metamorphosed Carboniferous sedimentary strata occurs in the northern margin of the Dabie Mountains, central China. It consists, in ascending order, of the upper Huayuanqiang Formation (C-1), the Yangshan Formation (C-1), the Daorenchong Formation (C1-2), the most widely distributed Huyoufang Formation (C-2) and the Yangxiaozhuang Formation (C-2). The provenance of the Carboniferous sedimentary rocks is constrained by the integration of trace elements, detrital mineral chemistry and sensitive high resolution ion microprobe (SHRIMP) dating of detrital zircons, which can help to understand the connection between the provenance and the Paleozoic tectonic evolution of the Qinling-Dabie Orogen. The trace element compositions indicate that the source terrain was probably a continental island arc. Detrital tourmalines were mainly derived from aluminous and Al-poor metapelites and metapsammites, and some are sourced from Li-poor granitoids, pegmatites and aplites. Detrital garnets, found only in the uppermost Huyoufang Formation, are almandine and Mn-almandine garnets, indicating probable sources mainly from garnetiferous schists, and partly from granitoid rocks. The detrital white K-micas are muscovitic in the Huayuanqiang, Daorenchong and Huyoufang Formations, and phengitic with Si contents (p.f.u.) from 3.20 up to max. 3.47-3.53 in the uppermost Huyoufang and the Yangxiaozhuang Formations, a meta-sedimentary source. Major components in the detrital zircon age structure for the Huyoufang Formation range from 506 to 363 Ma, centering on similar to 400 and similar to 480 Ma, which is characteristic of the Qinling and Erlangping Groups in the Qinling and Tongbai Mountains, central China. Evidently, the major source of the Carboniferous sedimentary rocks in the northern margin of Dabie Mountains was from the southern margin of the Sino-Korean Craton represented by the Qinling and Erlangping Groups. The source area was an island-arc system during the Early Paleozoic that collided with the Sino-Korea plate towards the end of the Early Paleozoic or during the Devonian. A prominent feature in the detrital zircon age structure of the Huyoufang Formation is the Neoproterozoic detritus, which could be derived only from the Yangtze Craton. Reasonable interpretation of the two distinct source materials for the Huyoulfang Formation is that the two plates were juxtaposed through collision before the late Carboniferous.

   abstract = {The Mesozoic strata, within the Bangong-Nujiang suture zone in central Tibet, recorded critical information about the subduction-accretion processes of the Bangong-Nujiang Ocean prior to the Lhasa-Qiangtang collision. This paper reports detailed field observations, petrographic descriptions, sandstone detrital zircon U-Pb ages and Hf isotopic analyses from an accretionary complex (preserved as Mugagangri Group) and the unconformably overlying Shamuluo Formation near Gaize. The youngest detrital zircon ages, together with other age constraints from literature, suggest that the Mugagangri Group was deposited during late Triassic-early Jurassic, while the Shamuluo Formation was deposited during late Jurassic-early Cretaceous. Based on the differences in lithology, age and provenance, the Mugagangri Group is subdivided into the upper, middle and lower subunits. These units are younging structurally downward/southward, consistent with models of progressive off-scrapping and accretion in a southward-facing subduction complex. The upper subunit, comprising mainly quartz-sandstone and siliceous mud/shale, was deposited in abyssal plain environment close to the Qiangtang passive margin during late Triassic, with sediments derived from the southern Qiangtang block. The middle and lower subunits comprise mainly lithic-quartz-sandstone and mud/shale, containing abundant ultramafic/ophiolitic fragments. The middle subunit, of late Triassic-early Jurassic age, records a transition in tectono-depositional setting from abyssal plain to trench-wedge basin, with sudden influx of sediments sourced from the central Qjangtang metamorphic belt and northern Qjangtang magmatic belt. The appearance of ultramafic/ophiolitic fragments in the middle subunit reflects the subduction initiation. The lower subunit was deposited in a trench-wedge basin during early Jurassic, with influx of Jurassic-aged zircons originating from the newly active southern Qiangtang magmatic arc. The lower subunit records the onset of arc magmatism related to the northward subduction of the Bangong-Nujiang Ocean. The Shamuluo Formation, comprising mainly lithic-feldspar-sandstone with limestone interlayers, was deposited in a post-collisional residual-sea or pre-collisional trench-slope basin, with sediments derived entirely from the Qiangtang block.

   abstract = {Cenozoic conglomerates are exposed discontinuously along the length of the Yarlung Tsangpo suture zone on the southernmargin of the Gangdese arc. These conglomerates (the "Gangdese Conglomerates" herein) record a crucial stage in the uplift and erosion histories of the southern Tibet after the initial India-Asia collision. In the Mt. Kailas area, the Gangdese Conglomerates strata consist of multiple sedimentary cycles and each cycle is a fining-upward sequence that was deposited by alluvial fan, braided-river and delta systems. Whereas in the Xigaze area, the Gangdese Conglomerates strata comprise a coarsening-upward sequence that was deposited by delta, braided-river and alluvial fan systems. Based on the detrital and igneous zircon U-Pb ages, the depositional ages of the Gangdese Conglomerates are late Oligocene to early Pliocene (ca. 26-5 Ma) in the Mt. Kailas area, late Oligocene to middle Miocene (ca. 26-15 Ma) in the Xigaze area, and late Oligocene to early Miocene (ca. 26-19 Ma) in the Zedong area. Paleocurrent measurements and provenance data (i.e., conglomerate clast composition, sandstone petrology and detrital zircon age) indicate that the initial detritus of the Gangdese Conglomerates were entirely derived from the north (mainly from the Gangdese arc). Sediment resulting from denudation to the south (the Xigaze forearc basin, the Yarlung Tsangpo suture zone and the northern margin of the Indian plate) first appeared by the early Miocene (ca. 19 Ma) and subsequently increased in abundance gradually. Our new results, together with previous data from the Xigaze area, reveal 3 major stages in the evolution of the Yarlung Tsangpo River system: (1) the southward-flowing stage (ca. 26-19 Ma) featured southward-draining transverse rivers that transported materials from the Gangdese arc southward. Southward paleocurrents in the Gangdese Conglomerates indicate a northern source. (2) The westward-flowing stage (ca. 19-15 Ma) developed due to the uplift of the suture zone and Tethys Himalaya to the south. Northward-draining rivers began to develop, and lakes resembling a string of beads formed and finally connected together, initiating the westward flowing paleo-Yarlung Tsangpo River. Westward paleoflows were recorded in the Gangdese Conglomerates. (3) The eastward-flowing stage (ca. 15 Ma-present) resulted from differential uplift and denudation of the southern Tibet, which reversed the direction of the young Yarlung Tsangpo River by ca. 15 Ma. The deposition of the Gangdese Conglomerates was controlled by eastward paleoflows. At this point, the modern eastward-flowing Yarlung Tsangpo River system was established.

   abstract = {Detrital zircon U-Pb dating of the Xingfuzhilu Formation in southern Inner Mongolia yields a maximum depositional age of around 220 Ma. The predominantly Permian and Triassic zircons are characterized by oscillatory zoning and euhedral shapes, with mostly positive zircon epsilon(Hf)(t) values (+2.0 to +16.4), indicating that they were derived from a proximal magmatic source. Early-Middle Paleozoic zircons have variable zircon epsilon(Hf)(t) values from -6.2 to +11.2 and are characterized by weak oscillatory zoning and subhedral-subrounded shapes, suggesting that the sources are a proximal magmatic arc, possibly mixed with components of the Ondor Sum magmatic arc and the magmatic arc at the northern margin of the North China Craton. The remnants of Precambrian blocks in the southeastern Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB), and the North China Craton may also have been a minor source region for the Xingfuzhilu succession. These results, combined with regional data, indicate that a closing remnant ocean basin or narrow seaway possibly existed in the Middle Permian (Guadalupian) immediately prior to final collision of the CAOB and closure of the Paleo-Asian Ocean. Subsequent collision resulted in the crustal uplift and thickening along the Solonker suture zone, accompanied by possible slab break-off and lithospheric delamination during the Latest Permian to Middle Triassic. The resultant orogen in the Late Triassic underwent exhumation and denudation of rocks in response to the postorogenic collapse and regional extension. Vertical crustal growth in the Triassic is documented by detrital zircons from the Xingfuzhilu Formation and appears to have been widespread across entire eastern CAOB.},

   abstract = {Reconstructing the evolution of the Bangong-Nujiang Tethyan Ocean (BNTO) plays an indispensable role in understanding the linkage between Gondwana dispersion and Tibetan Plateau accretion. The existence of the BNTO is inferred from presence of dismembered ophiolite bodies along the Bangong-Nujiang suture zone, which separates Lhasa from Qiangtang. In this paper, we present a detailed synthesis of ophiolite, metamorphism, magmatism, lithostratigraphy and tectonism from the western segment (Gerze area) of the Lhasa-Qiangtang collision zone in order to reconstruct the Wilson cycle of the BNTO. Our results suggest that the BNTO initially opened in the Late Permian (similar to 260 Ma), as indicated by the earliest record of oceanic crust. Regionally, strong evidence supports a northward subduction of the BNTO beneath Qiangtang, likely initiating in the Early Jurassic (similar to 195 Ma). As suggested by detrital zircon age spectra from Mesozoic arc-sourced strata, northward oceanic subduction generated three episodes of arc magmatism, i.e., similar to 186-170 Ma, similar to 169-146 Ma and similar to 129-100 Ma along the southern Qiangtang margin, in which the Early Jurassic magmatism is only sporadically preserved in modern outcrops (Amdo area). Meanwhile, the recognition of an incomplete arc-trench system on the northern Lhasa margin supports a southward subduction beneath Lhasa as well. Our new provenance data from Lower Cretaceous strata on the northern Lhasa margin, together with available multi-disciplinary constraints, suggest that final closure of the BNTO did not occur until the latest Jurassic-Early Cretaceous (similar to 150-130 Ma). Therefore, the Wilson cycle of the BNTO is hereby reconstructed, providing significant insights into the amalgamation of the Tibetan Plateau.},

   abstract = {Identifying arc-trench systems along with spatial and temporal variations in their record of tectono-magmatic events is crucial for determining the orogenic divers and evolution of orogenic systems. New geochronological and geochemical data of Jurassic igneous rocks, as well as detrital zircon data from contemporaneous sedimentary units, within the eastern Bangong-Nujiang suture in central Tibet indicate the existence of an approximately 1,200-km Middle-Late Jurassic magmatic arc system. This arc system can be divided into two distinct along-strike segments, which are characterized by magmatic activity extending from 166 to 160 Ma in the east and 170-148 Ma in the west, followed by magmatic gaps at 160-120 and 148-125 Ma, respectively. An accretionary prism, magmatic arc, and retro-arc sedimentary units are identified from south to north in the eastern segment. The 166-160 Ma arc includes high-K calc-alkaline granitoids, and high-Mg andesites, dacites, and rhyolites, which collectively can be interpreted to originate from partial melting of ancient lower crust and melange diapirs above a north dipping subduction zone. Our analysis reveals the existence of an overall compressional arc-trench system along strike, which overlaps with a phase of 170-160 Ma ophiolite generation and a rock association of 160-148 Ma slab-derived adakites and oceanic island basalt-type rocks, and is followed by an overall magmatic gap during 148-125 Ma with subsequent 125-105 Ma extensive magmatism. We infer that these records may reflect sequential tectonic events, including subparallel ridge-trench collision (170-160 Ma), slab window formation (160-148 Ma), subsequent subduction termination (148-125 Ma), and final Lhasa-Qiangtang amalgamation (125-105 Ma).},

   abstract = {The Songliao basin, situated between the Siberian and Sino-Korean (North China) cratons, was tectonically shaped by convergence of the Mongol-Okhotsk and Paleo-Pacific oceans. The lack of isotopic and geochemical data from its sedimentary rocks has hindered a better understanding of the depositional-tectonic history of the basin so far. A continuous sedimentary sequence is preserved in the upper part of the Songliao basin (Denglouku and Quantou formations). These rocks provide clues to depositional processes operating in this region during the late Cretaceous. Dominant zircon populations of the underlying Denglouku Formation are largely Paleozoic (270-250 Ma) and Mesozoic (190-170 Ma) in age, whereas the overlying Quantou Formation contains mostly older zircon populations of similar to 1800 Ma and similar to 2500-2900 Ma. The youngest detrital zircons place the deposition ages of both rock formations at about similar to 117 Ma and similar to 103 Ma, respectively. The Denglouku Formation is characterized by less negative initial epsilon(Nd) values (-6.3 to -2.8), younger Nd model ages (1.05-1.39 Ca) and lower initial Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios (0.7079 to 0.7088), compared to the Quantou Formation (-12.8, 1.75 C a and 0.7129), confirming that both formations were derived from different source areas. Our data suggest that Paleozoic and Mesozoic magmatic rocks were widespread in the northern periphery of the basin, and served as potential sources of the Denglouku Formation. In the south-east, old basement rocks of the North China craton provided sedimentary material for the Quantou Formation. The south-eastward migration of erosion center(s) in the Songliao basin in the late Mesozoic probably resulted from an abrupt change in basin uplift and subsidence. These processes were driven in response to regional tectonic changes toward an increasing dominance of the Pacific Ocean over the Mongol-Okhotsk Ocean subduction regime.

The strata underlying the mid-Cretaceous unconformity in the Songliao Basin show regionally distinct detrital zircon age populations and Nd isotopic compositions, which generally are characterized by Phanerozoic age peaks and relatively depleted Nd isotopic compositions, indicating derivation from nearby highlands. In contrast, the overlying strata are dominated by Proterozoic zircon ages and enriched Nd isotopic compositions, which imply that the provenance source region shifted to the northern part of the North China craton. A coeval provenance change also affected the sedimentary architecture in the eastern Dasanjiang basin group, marking the migration of erosion centers from west to east. The contribution from Lesser Xing'an- Zhangguangcai ranges was pronounced during deposition of synrift strata but became negligible afterward in the Songliao and Dasanjiang areas, which is consistent with both basin complexes temporarily forming an extensive lake system during the early Late Cretaceous. This paleolake was likely responsible for transgressive events recorded in the Late Cretaceous strata of basins in NE China. Combining observations from seismic reflection profiles and the stratigraphic record of neighboring intracontinental sedimentary basins as well as widespread contemporaneous exhumation and denudation events, we suggest that the provenance variation in basin strata was controlled by large-scale tectonic transitions in East Asia. The switch from extension to contraction during the mid-Cretaceous is attributed to the docking of the Okhotomorsk block along the East Asian continental margin. The resulting lithospheric buckling might have been responsible for reshaping the basin-and-range configuration in NE Asia.},

The syn-depositional zircons in the tuff layers and in the coeval igneous rocks exhibit uniform negative epsilon(Hf)(t) values of approximately -20 to -6, indicating the significant input of crustal materials. Massive crustal assimilation implies a large-scale remelting of the pre-existing continental crust, triggered by the intensive arccontinental collision during that time. This intensive collisional tectonomagmatic event is an important signal for the closing of the eastern Paleo-Tethys branch and points to the initial collision of the Indochina Block and the Yangtze Craton. Xenocrystic zircons in the Precambrian-age offer insight into the early evolution of the southwestern Yangtze Craton, which shows episodic crustal growth and reworking of similar to 2.92.2 Ga, crustal reworking of similar to 1.91.7 Ga, rifting-related tectonomagmatism of similar to 1.61.4 Ga, and crustal growth of similar to 1.10.8 Ga. The older crystallization ages (3.42.5 Ga), lower initial Hf-176/Hf-177 values (0.28050.2813), negative epsilon(Hf)(t) values (-15.7 to -1.6), and two-stage Hf model ages (3.92.8 Ga) of zircons further suggest that an unexposed Archean basement exists beneath the southwestern Yangtze Craton. Significant contributions of mantle-derived materials occur at similar to 1.31.0 Ga, implying that the southwestern Yangtze Craton may not be involved in the Grenvillian-aged continentalcontinental collision orogeny. Comparable age spectrums and Hf isotopic data suggest that the Paleoproterozoic igneous rocks are a non-negligible provenance for Proterozoic metasedimentary in the Kangdian region.

   abstract = {Late Permian to Triassic ("Indosinian-aged") orogenesis and associated magmatism are widespread in southeastern China, but their causes and significance to the regional geodynamic evolution are highly controversial. We report in this study integrated in situ U-Pb, Hf and O isotope analyses of detrital zircons from the Middle to Late Permian sediments in southeastern China, and use these data to decipher the sedimentary provenances, regional magmatic barcode and crustal evolution processes. A total of 409 concordant U-Pb zircon analyses on five sedimentary samples exhibits four major age peaks at ca 1870 Ma, ca 445 Ma, ca 370 Ma and ca 280 Ma, one "broad" age group of ca 1180-960 Ma, and two subordinate peaks at ca 2530 Ma and ca 800 Ma All the Archean-aged detrital zircons are oval in shape with clear abrasive imprints, indicating long-distance transport and/or multi-cycled sedimentary processing from unknown Archean sources. In contrast, detrital zircons of the remaining age groups are mostly euhedral to subhedral crystals, suggesting short-distance transport. Zircon ages of ca 1870 Ma, ca 1180-960 Ma, ca 800 Ma, ca 445 Ma and ca 280 Ma are coeval with exposed magmatic rocks in the Cathaysia Block of southeastern China. The ubiquitous existence of ca 280 Ma detrital zircons in the studied sediments implies a widespread occurrence of Early Permian magmatic rocks in southeastern China coastal region. In situ Hf and O isotope analyses of detrital zircons reveal periods with growth of juvenile continental crust at ca 1870 Ma, ca 1400 Ma, ca 1140-940 Ma, ca 445 Ma and c. 280 Ma, alternating with reworking and recycling of continental crust at ca 1200 Ma, ca 830 Ma and ca 370 Ma The ca 280 Ma detrital zircons display coherent, negative correlations between epsilon Hf(T) and delta O-18 values, indicating that their igneous source rocks probably formed with reworking of ancient supracrustal materials by mantle-derived magmas in an active continental margin. This interpreted ca 280 Ma magmatic event in an active continental margin is coincident with the remarkable change in regional palaeogeography from a carbonate platform in Carboniferous-earliest Permian time to an elongated uplift along the southeastern coastal regions in mid-Early Permian. Therefore, the early Indosinian tectonism and magmatism in southeastern South China most likely reflect the formation of a continental arc by the subduction of the Paleo-Pacific plate in the Early Permian.

   abstract = {Detrital zircons were recovered from several units within the Lower Cretaceous sedimentary cover of the northwestern Sichuan Basin, and dated using U-Pb geochronology to assess their provenance and depositional setting. Five major age populations were identified in the U-Pb age spectra: a Neoarchean to late Palaeoproterozoic group (composed of two distinct age populations at 2754-2151 and 2102-1627 Ma), a Neoproterozoic group (979-621 Ma), an Early Ordovician to Early Carboniferous group (478-326 Ma), an Early Permian to Late Triassic group (297-205 Ma), and an Early Jurassic to earliest Cretaceous group (188-138 Ma). Each of these age populations corresponds with one or several potential sources around the NWSB; the Neoarchean to late Palaeoproterozoic zircons are primarily derived from the South Qinling Belt, the northern Yangtze Craton, the Bikou terrane, and the Songpan-Ganzi terrane, with an additional contribution from the southwestern Yangtze craton in the Neoproterozoic. Recycling of sediments in the Songpan-Ganzi terrane and the South Qinling Belt may be the source of the Early Ordovician to Early Carboniferous zircon population. Early Permian to Late Triassic zircons are predominantly sourced from Triassic granitoids in the South Qinling Belt, as well as the Late Triassic Songpan-Ganzi turbidites during their eastward transportation. Recycling of Upper Jurassic to Lower Cretaceous sediments in the Qinling orogen most likely supplied the observed population of Jurassic to Early Cretaceous age zircons. Detrital zircon age distributions in Lower Cretaceous sediments record a pro-foreland basin setting characterized by intracontinental subduction. Oblique or tangential compression arising from clockwise rotation of the South China Block (SCB) served as an additional driver for the formation of the Cretaceous pro-foreland basin, and reactivation and inheritance may produce differentiation.

Our new SHRIMP U-Pb zircon ages from the Datong area provide new information about the Palaeozoic evolution of the Western Kunlun Orogen. A 473.0 +/- 2.8Ma granite with 493.6 +/- 4.8Ma inherited zircons from the Kusilafu extrusive rocks is interpretation as an A-type granite formed in a fore-arc tectonic setting. The 485.5 +/- 1.9Ma granitoid of the Datongdong pluton combined with the 452.7 +/- 7Ma granitoid of the Datong pluton indicate that the Datong pluton is an intra-oceanic arc complex formed by the southern subduction of the Proto-Tethyan ocean crust. Zircons from gabbros of the Datong mafic-ultramafic complex have a 499.2 +/- 2.1Ma U-Pb crystallization age. Combined with its complicated whole-rock geochemistry, we propose that there may have existed a Datong seamount in the early Palaeozoic. The detrital zircon results of Silurian-Devonian sandstones reveal that the Late Silurian sandstones have the characteristic zircons both from the Tarim Block and Datong Arc, suggesting that the Datong arc collided with the Tarim Block in the Late Silurian. The tectonic history of the WKO was characterized by a southern subduction of Proto-Tethys terminated in the Late Silurian.},

   abstract = {The Solonker suture zone has long been considered to mark the location of the final disappearance of the Paleo-Asian Ocean in the eastern Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB). However, the time of final suturing is still controversial with two main different proposals of late Permian to early Triassic, and late Devonian. This study reports integrated whole-rock geochemistry and LA-ICP-MS zircon U-Pb ages of sedimentary rocks from the Silurian Xuniwusu Formation, the Devonian Xilingol Complex and the Permian Zhesi Formation in the Hegenshan-Xilinhot-Linxi area in central Inner Mongolia, China. The depositional environment, provenance and tectonic setting of the Silurian-Devonian and the Permian sediments are compared to constrain the tectonic evolution of the Solonker suture zone and its neighboring zones. The protoliths of the silty slates from the Xuniwusu Formation in the Baolidao zone belong to wacke and were derived from felsic igneous rocks with steady-state weathering, poor sorting and compositional immaturity. The protoliths of metasedimentary rocks from the Xilingol Complex were wackes and litharenites and were sourced from predominantly felsic igneous rocks with variable weathering conditions and moderate sorting. The Xuniwusu Formation and Xilingol Complex samples both have two groups of detrital zircon that peak at ca. 0.9-1.0 Ga and ca. 420-440 Ma, with maximum deposition ages of late Silurian and middle Devonian age, respectively. Considering the ca. 484-383 Ma volcanic arc in the Baolidao zone, the Xuxiniwu Formation represents an oceanic trench sediment and is covered by the sedimentary rocks in the Xilingol Complex that represents a continental slope sediment in front of the arc. The middle Permian Zhesi Formation metasandstones were derived from predominantly felsic igneous rocks and are texturally immature with very low degrees of rounding and sorting, indicating short transport and rapid burial. The Zhesi Formation in the Hegenshan zone has a main zircon age peak of 302 Ma and a subordinate peak of 423 Ma and was deposited in a back-arc basin with an early marine transgression during extension and a late marine regression during contraction. The formation also crops out locally in the Baolidao zone with a main zircon age peak of 467 Ma and a minor peak of 359 Ma, and suggests it formed as a marine transgression sedimentary sequence in a restricted extensional basin and followed by a marine regressive event. Two obvious zircon age peaks of 444 Ma and 280 Ma in the Solonker zone and 435 Ma and 274 Ma in Ondor Sum are retrieved from the Zhesi Formation. This suggests as a result of the gradual closure of the Paleo-Asian Ocean a narrow ocean sedimentary environment with marine regressive sedimentary sequences occupied the Solonker and Ondor Sum zones during the middle Permian. A restricted ocean is suggested by the Permian strata in the Bainaimiao zone. Early Paleozoic subduction until ca. 381 Ma and renewed subduction during ca. 310-254 Ma accompanied by the opening and closure of a back-arc basin during ca. 298-269 Ma occurred in the northern accretionary zone. In contrast, the southern accretionary zone documented early Paleozoic subduction until ca. 400 Ma and a renewed subduction during ca. 298-246 Ma. The final closure of the Paleo-Asian ocean therefore lasted at least until the early Triassic and ended with the formation of the Solonker suture zone.},

However, there is a long-standing debate on the tectonic setting and onset uplift of the Bogeda Shan. In this study, we report detrital zircon U-Pb geochronology and whole-rock geochemistry of the Permian sandstone samples, to decipher the provenance and tectonic evolution of the West Bogeda Shan. The Lower-Middle Permian sandstone is characterized by a dominant zircon peak age at 300-400 Ma, similar to the Carboniferous samples, suggesting their provenance inheritance and from North Tian Shan (NTS) and Yili-Central Tian Shan (YCTS). While the zircon record of the Upper Permian sandstone is characterized by two major age peaks at ca. 335 Ma and ca. 455 Ma, indicating the change of provenance after the Middle Permian and indicating the uplift of Bogeda Shan. The initial uplift of Bogeda Shan was also demonstrated by structural deformations and unconformity occurring at the end of Middle Permian. The bulk elemental geochemistry of sedimentary rocks in the West Bogeda Shan suggests the Lower-Middle Permian is mostly greywacke with mafic source dominance, and tectonic setting changed from the continental rift in the Early Permian to post rift in the Middle Permian. The Upper Permian mainly consists of litharenite and sublitharenite with mafic-intermediate provenances formed in continental island arcs. The combined evidences suggest the initial uplift of the Bogeda Shan occurred in the Late Permian, and three stages of mountain building include the continental rift, post-rift extensional depression, and continental arc from the Early, Middle, to Late Permian, respectively.},

   title = {Was the Pamir salient built along a Late Paleozoic embayment on the southern Asian margin?},
   journal = {Earth and Planetary Science Letters},
   volume = {550},
   abstract = {While the northward convex Pamir salient has been interpreted to be a Cenozoic feature, resulting from terranes of the Pamir experiencing similar to 300 km of northward translation relative to Tibet and Afghanistan during the India-Asia collision, structural evidence for large magnitudes of translation is generally lacking. We focus on the geology of the Northern Pamir, which forms the outer margin of the salient, to argue that the Pamir salient has not experienced significant northward translation as has been suggested by several recent studies. We then present evidence based on new detrital zircon results that the Pamir salient may be an inherited feature from the Late Paleozoic southern margin of Asia. Kinematic endmember models of northward translation of the Pamir predict either similar to 300 km of arc-parallel extension (radial thrusting model) or truncation of geologic terranes at the margins of the salient by strike-slip faults (transfer faulting model). However, both models are inconsistent with the regional geology and structural evolution, which shows minimal extension along outer arc of the Pamir (similar to 50 km) and no clear truncation or thinning of geologic terranes that make up the Northern Pamir. Regarding the origin of the Pamir salient, a pronounced change in detrital zircon age signature of the Northern Pamir from west to east suggests the regions were not directly connected (i.e. part of a continuous linear belt), and were sourced from distinct cratons. Further, an absence of Triassic arc/forearc flysch deposits and arc plutons along WNW portion of the Northern Pamir suggests the possibility of a transform boundary segment along the Triassic Paleo-Tethys oceanic subduction zone. Based on these observations, we suggest an embayment existed between Tarim and Karakum Cratons after their amalgamation to the southern margin of Asia in the Early Permian. During the Late Triassic, colliding Cimmerian Gondwanan terranes (Central-Southern Pamir) filled in the embayment, resulting in the northward deflection in the trace of the Paleotethyan suture zone and Gondwanan terranes and the current arcuate geometry of the Pamir. Subsequent Cenozoic northward translation of the Pamir is interpreted to be only similar to 50 km, no more than similar to 80-100 km, and may be coupled with northward translation of northwestern Tibet and northeastern Afghanistan.

   abstract = {The provenance of Jurassic to Cretaceous sediments in the Sichuan Basin is constrained by sandstone petrology and detrital zircon U-Pb geochronology, which provide critical insights into the mid-late Mesozoic paleogeography of the Sichuan Basin. The petrography of 22 sandstone samples suggests moderately-to-highly mature sediments, which are primarily derived from cratonic or recycled sources. Detrital zircon U-Pb ages from Middle Jurassic to Late Cretaceous are classified into age groups of 130-200 Ma, 200-330 Ma, 400-490 Ma, 680890 Ma, 1730-1960 Ma, and 2360-2600 Ma. The Middle Jurassic sediments contain a relatively high density of -260 Ma, similar to 1.85 Ga, and similar to 2.5 Ga zircons as well as a low density of -800 Ma zircons, consistent with the derivation from the Emeishan large igneous province, the Songpan-Ganzi terrane, and the South Qinling Belt, and to a lesser extent, from the Western Jiangnan Orogen. The Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous sediments with scattered age distribution share common multiple source-to-sink systems, which were predominantly draining toward the south and southeast, with southward drainage being higher; subsequently, they were disrupted by a synchronous northeastward drainage capture. Late Cretaceous sediments have a distinct reduction in zircons younger than 213 Ma, suggesting southeastward and southwestward transport of sediments that were likely derived from the Songpan-Ganzi terrane, the Sanjiang Orogen, the south segment of the Longmenshan thrust belt and the western Yangtze Craton, and areas of uplift in the northern and northeastern Sichuan Basin. Changes in the provenance during the mid-late Mesozoic coincide with the spatiotemporal variations in the depocenter migration and paleogeographic evolution of the Sichuan Basin, which are closely related to the multistage intracontinental subduction associated with the clockwise rotation of the South China Block.

U-Pb isotopic dating using the LA-ICP-MS method on zircons from the Paleoproterozoic metasedimentary rocks reveals that the depositional age can be constrained in the period between 1.98 and 1.9 Ga.

Detailed analysis of detrital zircon U-Pb geochronology, whole-rock Sm-Nd isotope, and geochemistry show that these metasedimentary rocks are derived from a mixed provenance. The predominant derivation is from metavolcanic rocks of the Liaohe Group and Paleoproterozoic gneissic granitoids. There is also an input of Archean continental crust. The metasedimentary rocks were probably deposited in a back-arc basin within an arc system, thus supporting the Paleoproterozoic arc-continent collision model as already proposed by some authors.

Detrital zircon U-Pb ages and Lu-Hf isotopes from the Puyu, Luotuopan, and Hejiazhai formations are used in this study to constrain the depositional age and provenance of the Wufoshan Group and crustal evolution of the NCC. The Puyu Formation is characterized by detrital zircon U-Pb age populations of similar to 2.13 Ga and similar to 2.50 Ga, similar to the Lower-Upper Ma'anshan formations from the literature. The Luotuopan Formation exhibits age populations of 1.85-2.18 Ga and 2.28-2.98 Ga, with mainly negative epsilon(Hf)(t) values and scattered positive epsilon(Hf)(t) values clustering at two groups of 2.48-2.52 Ga and 2.64-2.97 Ga. The Hejiazhai Formation displays age populations of 0.98-2.00 Ga and 2.51-2.79 Ga with mainly positive epsilon(Hf)(t) values, whose depositional age is constrained as Neoproterozoic era by the youngest graphical detrital zircon age of 976 +/- 20 Ma. Provenance studies indicate that the Mesoproterozoic Lower-Upper Ma'anshan and Puyu formations were sourced from the middle Trans-North China Orogen (TNCO), while the Neoproterozoic Luotuopan and Hejiazhai formations were derived from the southern TNCO and the North Qinling Terrane, respectively. The clastic rock series in the southern NCC is divided into Luotuopan type and Hejiazhai type by detrital zircon U-Pb age pattern and Hf isotopic characteristics, suggesting Late Mesoarchean to Early Palaeoproterozoic (2.47-2.97 Ga) crustal growth in the interior NCC, and Late Palaeoproterozoic to Early Neoproterozoic (0.98-2.08 Ga) crustal growth in the marginal NCC.

   abstract = {Detrital composition and major element geochemistry of Jurassic sandstones in the south Hefei Basin, central China, show their provenance to be the Dabie Mountains, whose tectonic attributes are closely related to continent-island arc complexes. It was found that a provenance change, from recycled orogen signatures and mixed orogenic sandstones to arc orogen, occurs from the lower Middle Jurassic to the Upper Jurassic (the Zhougongshan Formation). Dissected magmatic arc sources were gradually exposed in the Dabie Mountains due to intensive exhumation during the Late Jurassic, particularly after the Fenghuangtai depositional phase. Furthermore, it can be infered that the magmatic arc was initially present in both the Early Paleozoic and the Triassic, according to isotopic dating studies in previously published reports. delta(13)C-delta(18)O tracing between existing marbles of different strata in the Dabie block and marble gravels of the Fenghuangtai Formation in the Hefei Basin indicate that partial lithostratigraphic units for the Jurassic provenances have entirely disappeared from the Dabie block; therefore, it is impossible to reconstruct integral orogenic processes from studies on the remaining Dabie block alone. These findings, together with basin-fill sequences, also suggest that the Hefei Basin was mainly subjected to compressive mechanical regimes rather than extensional regimes in the Jurassic, which resulted in reverse-grading clastic depositional sequences, and is probably related to the northward intracontinental deep subduction of the Yangtze Plate. Regional exhumation properties and a tectonic model of the Late Mesozoic Dabie orogenesis are discussed in this paper.},

   abstract = {We present a systematic study of micaschists and felsic gneisses from the Huangyuan Group of the Central Qilian block in NW China, with aims to unravel the connection with the Rodinia supercontinent. The micaschists have detrital zircon ages of 2895-928 Ma that peaking at 1.80-1.40 Ga. They show strongly increasing zircon epsilon Hf(t) values of -8.1 to +12.1 from 1.6 Ga to 1.4 Ga. Detrital zircon ages from the felsic gneisses are dominantly 960-913 Ma with epsilon Hf(t) values of -0.1 to -10.7. The micaschists have a wide range of whole-rock major element compositions, and the felsic gneisses have higher SiO2 contents, combined with lower other major element contents than those of the micaschists. All samples have trace element compositions consistent with upper continental crustal origin. The protoliths of the micaschists are dominantly shales and minor wackes with maximum depositional ages from ca. 1317 to 928 Ma. The protoliths of the felsic gneisses are mostly wackes with a maximum depositional age of ca. 927 Ma. The source materials for these metasedimentary rocks originated from intermediate to felsic igneous rocks. The variable maximum depositional ages of the metasedimentary rocks in the Huangyuan Group indicate that their pmtoliths constituted a sedimentary series with a long history of deposition starting at ca. 1317 Ma in an oceanic island arc-related basin that developed through a transitional continental arc-related basin into an active continental marginal basin at ca. 927 Ma. It is inferred that the 1795-1321 Ma detritus was sourced from juvenile arc crust at the margin of the Indian or the Western Australian craton. The source rocks for 1317-913 Ma detritus were arc magmatic rocks formed during assembly of Rodinia. A sequence of initial intra-oceanic subduction (ca. 1317-967 Ma) and continuous oceanic crust-continent subduction with formation of a mature continental arc (ca. 967-896 Ma) at the margin of Rodinia during the formation of the Central Qilian block is suggested.},

   abstract = {Previously published research from the Kuqa Subbasin along northern margin of the Tarim Basin shows five tectonic-depositional phases from Triassic to Neogene time. In order to reveal additional detailed information on the nature of provenance terrains and tectonic attributes since late Mesozoic time, five typical sandstone samples from Jurassic-Neogene strata were collected for U-Pb dating of detrital zircons. Geochronological constitution of detrital zircons of the Middle Jurassic sample is essentially unimodal and indicates major contributions from the South Tian Shan even Yili-Central Tian Shan, wherein most 370-450 Ma zircons probably resulted from tectonic accretion events between the Yili-Central Tian Shan block and South Tian Shan Ocean during Silurian and Devonian time, with sandstone provenance tectonic attributes of passive continental margin. The Lower Cretaceous sample shows a complicated provenance detrital zircon signature, with new peak ages of 290-330 Ma as well as 370(or 350)-450 Ma showing evident arc orogenic provenance tectonic attribute, probably reflecting a new provenance supply that resulted from denudation process whthin the South Tian Shan and South Tian Shan suture. There are no obvious changes within age probability spectra of detrital zircons between the Cretaceous and early Paleogene samples, which suggests that similar provenance types and basin-range framework continued from Cretaceous to Early Paleogene time. However, unlike the Cretaceous and early Paleogene samples, an age spectra of the Miocene sample is relatively unimodal and similar to that of the Pliocene sample, with peak ages ranging between similar to 392 and similar to 458 Ma older than the comparable provenance ages (peak ages about 370-450 Ma) of the Middle Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous samples. Therefore, we conclude that the South Tian Shan was rapidly exhumated and the southern South Tian Shan had become the main source of clastics for the Kuqa Subbasin since the Miocene epoch.},

   abstract = {The Tarim Block, one of the largest Precambrian cratonic blocks in East Asia, is located in northwestern China. The Precambrian formation and evolution of the Tarim Block, and its tectonic affinity to other major continental blocks in China, specifically the North China Craton (NCC) and the South China Block (SCB), remain poorly understood, in spite of their implications for understanding the ancient tectonic framework of East Asia. To achieve a better understanding of the Precambrian tectonothermal history of the Tarim Block, we have undertaken U-Pb dating and Lu-Hf isotopic analyses of detrital zircons from late Neoproterozoic-early Permian sandstones in the Aksu area of the northwestern Tarim Basin. The morphologies, Th/U ratios, U-Pb ages and Lu-Hf isotopes of these detrital zircons indicate magmatic episodes took place in the late Neoarchaean-early Palaeoproterozoic (ca. 2.6-2.4 Ga, peak at 2.48 Ga), middle Palaeoproterozoic (ca. 2.0-1.8 Ga, peak at 1.87 Ga), latest Mesoproterozoic-early Neoproterozoic (ca. 1.05-0.9 Ga, peak at 0.94 Ga), middle Neoproterozoic (ca. 0.85-0.7 Ga, peak at 0.78 Ga), and early Palaeozoic (ca. 0.45-0.4 Ga, peak at 0.43 Ga). By integrating our results with previous geological observations, we argue that the Tarim Block as a whole was affected by Precambrian tectonothermal events at ca. 2.6-2.4, 2.0-1.8, 1.05-0.9 and 0.85-0.7 Ga. These events are respectively thought to have been associated with a late Neoarchaean-early Palaeoproterozoic global continent-building event, the assembly of the Palaeoproterozoic Columbia supercontinent, the latest Mesoproterozoic-early Neoproterozoic accretion of the Tarim Block to the Rodinia supercontinent, and the middle Neoproterozoic separation of the Tarim Block from Rodinia. Comparisons of detrital zircon U-Pb age spectra, geochronological data for magmatic and metamorphic rocks, in situ zircon Lu-Hf isotopes, and other geological data from among the Tarim Block, the NCC and the SCB point to a close tectonic affinity between the Tarim Block and the SCB in the Neoproterozoic. However, during 2.6-1.8 Ga, the Tarim Block underwent a different tectonic evolution from the SCB, and instead was tectonically linked to the NCC. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The similarity of these time-series profiles resulted from orogensis and intracontinental deformation of the provenance area, the (ancestral) Tian Shan. Mineralogical maturities of Conglomerates and sandstones increase from Triassic to Middle Jurassic and decrease from Upper Jurassic-Lower Cretaceous to Tertiary. This, trend parallels a similar decrease in maturity in detrital heavy minerals. Zircon. rutile and tourmaline dominate in Middle-Upper Triassic to Middle Jurassic sandstone, whereas unstable hornblende and pyroxene dominate the heavy mineral suites in the Tertiary, especially in Miocene and Pliocene strata. These compositional trends are coeval with gradual southward migration of alluvial depositional fronts and depositional depocenters from Cretaceous to Miocene. Since the Pliocene. lame-scale southward migration of alluvial depositional systems occurred while depositional depocenters migrated northward. Based on the Mesozoic-Cenozoic depositional records, the tectonic evolution of the Tian Shan-Kuqa subbasin amy be, divided into five phases. (1) In Early Triassic, following compression and uplift since Permian, gravelly braided river-alluvial plain depositional systems developing in the Kuqa subbasin. characterized by sands of mixed orogenic provenance tyke derived front the ancestral Tian Shan. (2) From Middle Triassic to Middle Jurassic. sediment composition of the Kuqa subbasin refucas arc orogen and mixed orogenic sand types, with extensive planation of the ancestral Tian Shan and the development of relatively stable coal-bearing depositional environments. (3) Renewed compression-uplift of the Tian Shan occurred in Lie Mesozoic, especially in Cretaceous, with most detrital modes of the Kuqa subbasin indicating provenance attributes akin to the South Tian Shan. (4) Further intensive compression-uplift and. probably southward (basinward) propagation of the South Tian Shan occurred during Miocene; and (5) supracrustal gravity gliding and collapse occurred in the Tian Shao-Kuqa subbasin probably due to intensive deep compression, with rejuvenated uplift and probable southward (basinward) structural propagation of the South Tian Shan developing since Pliocene. Observed changes in sediment composition and depositional environment since Pliocene time were also controlled by frequent and abrupt climate changes in addition to intensive uplift of the Tian Shan. Moreover, all depositional records in the Kuqa subbasin seem to reflect west to east differences in provenance along the Tian Shan, probably indicating greater exhumation depth in the western Tian Shan than that in the eastern Tian Shan since Early Cretaceous.

   abstract = {A series of significant geological changes indicated by deformation, magmatic-metallogenic systems, and the climate and environment occurred in East Asia during Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous time, but the timing and development of the Yanshan movement' on the north margin of the North China Craton has not been well-established. Based on the evidence of tectonic deformation and magmatic activity, previous studies resulted in two views of the beginning of the Yanshan movement: Early Jurassic vs. late Middle Jurassic. In this work, the timing of the initial Yanshan movement was investigated by examining the Jurassic Chenjiabangou section in the Ningwu-Jingle basin overlying the north-central part of the North China Craton. The timing of the initial Yanshan movement was constrained by restoration of stream flow directions, determination of boundaries of sedimentary cycles, identification of heavy mineral assemblages in clastic rocks, quantification of changes in chemical compositions, and zircon U-Pb isotope dating. The results indicate that the basal conglomerates of the Middle Jurassic Yungang Formation (Bathonian) mark the beginning of the Yanshan movements. Evidence supporting this conclusion includes the following. (1) The switch from transgressive lacustrine deposition to regressive lacustrine deposition in the Yungang Formation sedimentary succession indicates a change from extension to compression, possibly reflecting uplift. (2) Early-stage clastic rocks rich in quartz and feldspar are replaced by feldspar detritus in late-stage clastic rocks; the heavy mineral assemblage dominated by zircon at the early stages changed to garnet-dominated assemblage upsection. Moreover, the concentrations of CaO, MgO, CO2, and Fe2O3+FeO and the Fe2O3/FeO ratio changed abruptly near the basal conglomerates of the Middle Jurassic Yungang Formation, suggesting increased denudation. (3) Conglomerates at the bottom of the Middle Jurassic Yungang Formation were deposited approximately 168 million years ago, as inferred from the age of zircons in tuffaceous micrite (160.6 +/- 0.55Ma) at the bottom of the Upper Jurassic Tianchihe Formation (Oxfordian) and the age of zircons in pyroclastic rocks (179.2 +/- 0.79Ma) in the Lower Jurassic Yongdingzhuang Formation (Toarcian). These lines of evidence indicate that initial Jurassic Yanshan movement began 168million years ago during Middle Jurassic time.},

   abstract = {The Sibao Orogen in South China is one of the poorest known Grenville-aged orogenic belts through which the Neoproterozoic supercontinent Rodinia assembled. We report here the first UV laser spot Ar-40/Ar-39 mica and SHRIMP U-Pb zircon ages from a rare Grenville-aged metarnorphic complex, the Tianli Schists, in the eastern Sibao Orogen. Our U-Pb zircon provenance ages indicate that the protolith of the Tianli Schists was a elastic sedimentary succession most likely derived from the Yangtze Block. The depositional age of the protolith is younger than 1530 Ma, as constrained by the youngest detrital zircon grains, but is older than 1040 Ma as constrained by the oldest Ar-40/Ar-39 muscovite ages. The Yangtze Block provenance for the Tianli Schists suggests that the Sibaoan ophiolitic complexes in northeastern Jiangxi, the ca. 970 Ma Xiwan adakitic granite intrusions, and the ca. 900 Ma(?) Xiwan blueschists, all to the northwest of the study region, were likely formed during the closure of a back-arc basin along the margin of the Yangtze Block. Our in situ UV laser Ar-40/Ar-39 results from S, and S-2 muscovites suggest that the Tianli Schists underwent metamorphism and deformation at 1042 +/- 7Ma to 1015 +/- 4Ma, the oldest known metamorphic event in the eastern Sibao Orogen. Muscovite/biotite cooling ages of ca. 968 +/- 4 and 942 +/- 8 Ma are recorded by deformed and recrystallised muscovite and biotite, respectively, indicating tectonic reactivation before 900 Ma, during the later stages of the Sibao Orogeny. Together with previous results from the western Sibao Orogen, our work suggests that the closure of the ocean between the Yangtze and Cathaysia Blocks during the assembly of Rodinia was diachronous: >= 1000 Ma at the western Sibao Orogen and ca. 900 Ma at the eastern Sibao Orogen.(c) 2007 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {In recent decades, the Yanshanian movement in the Mesozoic has been a hotspot of much geological research, attracting numerous studies focusing on regional tectonics, basin evolution, and associated magmatism and volcanic activities. The Haifanggou Formation, exposed in Xingcheng Basin, which is one of intracontinental basins in western Liaoning Province, North China Craton (NCC), comprises mainly conglomerates dominated with interbedded sandstone. Although palaeontology, stratigraphy and lithofacies have been established, its mineralogical compositions and geochronology, even the provenance and implications for Yanshanian movement are still poorly discussed. Available sandstone samples provided a unique opportunity to study the genesis and further deciphered the tectonic mechanisms. The sandstone types of Haifanggou Formation are dominantly litho-feldspathic litharenite and litharenite. Modal sandstone analysis shows that the origin and deposition mainly are due to arid to semi-arid weathering and recycling of older rocks and magmatic arcs, eroded and transported debris from eastern NCC. Our new detrital zircon U-Pb ages exhibit that the maximum depositional ages of the Haifanggou Formation were conservatively estimated as late Middle Jurassic (165.6 +/- 3.1 Ma). The detrital zircon U-Pb age spectrum of this formation is dominated by several peaks that indicate a provenance from the surrounding rocks including the basement of NCC. The sedimentation of the Haifanggou Formation is deposited under compressional tectonics as a local response of the Yanshanian movement which was related to the subduction of Palaeo-Pacific Plate.},

   abstract = {The southwestern margin of the North China Craton (NCC) is located between the Alxa Terrane to the northwest, the North Qilian Orogen to the west and the North Qinling Orogen to the south. However, the paleogeographic and tectonic evolution for the southwestern part of the NCC in the Late Paleozoic is still poorly constrained. In order to constrain the Late Paleozoic tectonic evolution of the southwestern NCC, we carried out detailed field work and detrital zircon U-Pb geochronological research on Middle-Late Permian sedimentary rocks at the southwestern margin of the NCC. The U-Pb age spectra of detrital zircons from six samples are similar, showing four populations of 2.6-2.4 Ga, 2.0-1.7 Ga, 500-360Ma and 350-250Ma. Moreover, on the basis of the weighted-mean age of the youngest detrital zircons (257 +/- 4Ma), combined with the published results and volcanic interlayers, we propose that the Shangshihezi Formation formed during the Middle-Late Permian. Our results and published data indicate that the detrital zircons with age groups of 2.6-2.4 Ga and 2.0-1.7 Gawere likely derived from the Khondalite Belt and Yinshan Block in the northwestern NCC. The junction part between the North Qinling and North Qilian Orogen may provide the 500-360 Ma detrital zircons for the study area. The 350-250 Ma detrital zircons were probably derived fromthe northwestern part of the NCC. The majority of materials from Shangshihezi Formation within the study area were derived from the northwestern part of the NCC, indicating that the northwestern part of the NCC was strongly uplifted possibly resulting from the progressive subduction and closure of the Paleo-Asian Ocean. A small amount of materials were sourced from southwestern part of the NCC, indicating that the North Qinling Orogen experienced a minor uplift resulting from the northward subduction of the South Qinling terrane.

Moreover, the coeval geological evolution of the southern NQB has been poorly investigated, particularly its tectonic relationship with the CQMB. Here we present stratigraphic, sedimentary, and provenance analyses of the late Permian-middle Triassic depositional succession at Raggyorcaka in the southern NQB and test two radically different hypotheses for origin of the CQMB. A complete marine transgression-regression sequence with two-sided provenance characterizes the late Permian-Triassic sedimentary rocks in the southern NQB. Sandstone petrological analyses reveal a prominent provenance transition to an active volcanic source beginning in the late Changhsingian. Detrital zircon U-Pb geochronological results of the transgression subsequence show a concentrated youngest zircon group of 236-288 Ma (peak at 248.1 Ma), with negative epsilon Hf(t) values (-25.3 to -0.2) and large Hf crustal model ages (TDMC; 1,311-2,887 Ma). These new findings show that the Raggyorcaka sequence was most likely deposited in an active continental margin. Combined with other evidence, we further infer that the Carboniferous-Triassic successions of the southern NQB were most likely deposited in a forearc basin under the in situ suture model, that is, the northward subduction of the Longmu Co-Shuanghu Tethys Ocean beneath the NQB. Moreover, the detrital zircon age distribution of the southern NQB suggests that the NQB probably drifted from the Gondwana supercontinent in the early Paleozoic and became adjacent to peri-Cathaysian blocks no later than the Carboniferous.},

   abstract = {The Liuling Group is exposed in the Northern part of the South Qinling orogenic belt. LA-ICP-MS U-Pb analysis of detrital zircons from the meta-sandstones in this Group yields ages ranging between 400 Ma and 3200 Ma, with three prominent age clusters at 500-400 Ma, 850-700 Ma and 1000900 Ma. A few older zircon populations with U-Pb ages of 1750-1450 Ma, 2000 Ma and 26002400 Ma are also present. Age data integrated with cathodoluminescence, trace element data and epsilon(Hf)(t) values of zircon grains show that the Liuling sediments have a complex source. Source rocks mainly include Early Neoproterozoic and Early Paleozoic granitoids, together with minor ultra-high pressure/high pressure (HP-UHP) metamorphic rocks, and paragneiss in the North Qinling belt, and Middle-Late Neoproterozoic magmatic rocks in the South Qinling belt. The dominant population of detrital zircon grains with ages between 500 Ma and 400 Ma show the characteristics of both magmatic and metamorphic zircons. They show three age clusters at 497 Ma, 451 Ma, and ca. 420 Ma and show marked correlation with the three stages of Palaeozoic magmatism, as well as with the peak and retrograde HP-UHP metamorphic stages in the North Qinling belt. This correlation demonstrates that these Early Palaeozoic granitoids and HP-UHP metamorphic rocks in the North Qinling belt were already exhumed to the surface, underwent erosion prior to Middle Devonian time and were then deposited in an extensional basin. Based on the results from detrital zircon U-Pb dating, combined with geochemical data and the regional geology, the deposition of Liuling sediments is inferred to have occurred in a post-orogenic extensional basin, rather than a subduction-related fore-arc basin or a foreland basin formed during or after continental collision.

   abstract = {The geological history of the Burmese subduction margin, where India obliquely subducts below Indochina, remains poorly documented although it is key to deciphering geodynamic models for the evolution of the broader Tibetan-Himalayan orogen. Various scenarios for the evolution of the orogen have been proposed, including a collision of India with Myanmar in the Paleogene, a significant extrusion of Myanmar and Indochina from the India-Asia collision zone, or very little change in paleogeography and subduction regime since the India-Asia collision. This article examines the history of the Burmese forearc basin, with a particular focus on Eocene-Oligocene times to reconstruct the evolution of the Burmese margin during the early stages of the India-Asia collision. We report on sedimentological, geochemical, petrographical, and geochronological data from the Chindwin Basin-the northern part of the Burmese forearc-and integrate these results with previous data from other basins in central Myanmar.
Our results show that the Burmese margin acted as a regular Andean-type subduction margin until the late middle Eocene, with a forearc basin that was open to the trench and fed by the denudation of the Andean volcanic arc to the east. We show that the modern tectonic configuration of central Myanmar formed 39-37 million years ago, when the Burmese margin shifted from an Andean-type margin to a hyper-oblique margin. The forearc basin was quickly partitioned into individual pull-apart basins, bounded to the west by a quickly emerged accretionary prism, and to the east by synchronously exhumed basement rocks, including coeval high-grade metamorphics. We interpret this shift as resulting from the onset of strike-slip deformation on the subduction margin leading to the formation of a paleo-sliver plate, with a paleo fault system in the accretionary prism, pull-apart basins in the forearc, and another paleo fault system in the backarc. This evolution implies that hyper-oblique convergence below the Burmese margin is at least twice older than previously thought. Our results reject any India-Asia convergence scenario involving an early Paleogene collision of India with Myanmar. In contrast, our results validate conservative geodynamic models arguing for a close-to-modern precollisional paleogeometry for the Indochina Peninsula, and indicate that any post-collisional rotation of Indochina, if it occurred at all, must have been achieved by the late middle Eocene.},

   abstract = {The loess and paleosol sequences of the Chinese Loess Plateau are composed of Quaternary dust, the origin of which has been the subject of considerable debate. Some recent U-Pb geochronological studies of eolian zircons have proposed the existence of two major wind pathways: from the north and northwest, through the Badan Jaran, Tengger, and Mu Us Deserts during interglacials, and from the west, through the Qaidam Basin during glacials. Others have emphasized the importance of Yellow River sediment supply in the Chinese Loess Plateau sediment budget. However, tracking dust source regions through U-Pb dating in a statistically robust manner is particularly complex given the similar age peaks in the age probability distributions of potential source regions in Central Asia. This paper presents 2410 new U-Pb ages of detrital zircons from wind-eroded strata, Quaternary eolian deposits, and modern river sands in central China in order to increase the robustness and the spatial resolution of zircon age distributions in dust source regions. We then propose a new mixture modeling technique to statistically address the contribution of these different sources to the Chinese Loess Plateau sedimentary budget. Our contribution estimates indicate that eolian supply to the Chinese Loess Plateau is dominated (60%-70%) by reworking of Yellow River sediment. Moreover, evidence of Qaidam Basin-sourced zircons (15%-20%) in both loess (glacial) and paleosol (interglacial) layers corroborates the existence of an erosive wind pathway through the Qaidam Basin during glacials and implies that a substantial portion of the interglacial dust is recycled from older glacial loess. We propose that sediment reworking of Yellow River sediment and older loess deposits by wind on the Chinese Loess Plateau homogenized the eolian zircon populations toward a glacial provenance due to higher (2-20 times) dust accumulation rates during glacials. These findings suggest that the Chinese Loess Plateau has evolved as a more dynamic landform than previous thought, where wind deflation, fluvial input, lateral transport, and accumulation of sediment are equally important. These internal reworking effects would then significantly bias the paleoclimatic interpretations based on eolian dust properties of the Chinese Loess Plateau.},

   abstract = {The Yanshan fold-thrust belt is a significant intraplate deformation belt along the northern margin of North China Craton and records multiple phases of deformation during the Mesozoic. However, the specific tectonic evolution of the Yanshan belt during the Mesozoic has long been debated. In particular, many arguments exit regarding whether a contractional or extensional context dominated the Yanshan belt in the Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous. One reason for this argument is the poor understanding of the tectono-sedimentary relationship preserved in the sedimentary records. A lack of evidence of syntectonic sediments makes it more difficult to reconstruct this relationship. The Chicheng basin in the western Yanshan belt contains complete Upper Jurassic-Lower Cretaceous succession and is bounded by marginal faults. New regional geological mapping, detailed sedimentary facies analysis, and recognition of two growth strata packages help reconstruct the tectono-sedimentary relationship in the Chicheng basin. Additionally, zircon U-Pb dating provides constraints on the timing of the deformation. Our results suggest that the dynamic sediment dispersal system in the Chicheng basin during the Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous were controlled by two phases of thrusting, including the activities of the Shangyi-Pingquan fault during 162-147 Ma, and the Fengning-Longhua fault during 140-135 Ma. Therefore, we propose that the western Yanshan belt was in a contractional context during the Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous. Our findings indicate that the tectonic setting of the Yanshan belt experienced a prominent transition from E-W trending structures to NE-SW trending structures and that this transition was probably related to subduction of the Paleo-Pacific plate beneath the East Asian continent.},

   abstract = {U-Pb dating was made by the LA-ICP-MS method for detrital zircons from the Wudangshan volcanic-sedimentary succession in the South Qinling. Samples comprise quartz sandstones of the Wudangshan Group collected from the base of the Yangping Formation and an upper layer of the Shuangtai Formation overlain its volcanic sequence, and two river-sand collections from the drainage systems cutting across the two formations, respectively. The results show that the Yangping detrital zircons are dominated by 830-780 Ma grains with a minor population of similar to 1.0-0.84 Ga and sporadic grains of similar to 2.6, similar to 2.4 and 2.0 Ga, whereas the Shuangtai zircons yield an upper intercept age of 763 +/- 33 Ma, identical to the timing of the Wudangshan volcanism within error, with few concordant grains of 1.9 and 0.86 Ga. Age spectra for the two river-sand samples are similar to those of the Yangping and Shuangtai Formations, respectively. It thus suggests that the Wudangshan strata are less than 780 Ma, whereas their major detrital zircon populations of 1.0-0.85 Ga and 830-780 Ma are consistent with timing of the Hannan magmatic activities along the northwestern margin of the South China Block. This suggests a Hannan or adjacent area provenance for the Wudangshan strata. The Wudang area is characterized by rift-related igneous events at similar to 755 and similar to 680 Ma, respectively, pointing to a tectonomagmatic history different from the Hannan area. It is inferred that the similar to 755 Ma magmatism is likely to indicate a separation of the South China Block from the supercontinent Rodinia, while the similar to 680 Ma event suggests a further split between the South Qinling and some unknown continent.},

   abstract = {The Junggar-Balkhash Ocean was a major branch of the southern Paleo-Asian Ocean. The timing of its closure is important for understanding the history of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt. New sedimentological and geochronological data from the Late Paleozoic volcano-sedimentary sequences in the Barleik Mountains of West Junggar, NW China, help to constrain the closure time of the Junggar-Balkhash Ocean. Tielieketi Formation (Fm) is dominated by littoral sediments, but its upper glauconite-bearing sandstone is interpreted to deposit rapidly in a shallow-water shelf setting. By contrast, Heishantou Fm consists chiefly of volcanic rocks, conformably overlying or in fault contact with Tielieketi Fm. Molaoba Fm is composed of parallel-stratified fine sandstone and sandy conglomerate with graded bedding, typical of nonmarine, fluvial deposition. This formation unconformably overlies the Tielieketi and Heishantou formations and is conformably covered by Kalagang Fm characterized by a continental bimodal volcanic association. The youngest U-Pb ages of detrital zircons from sandstones and zircon U-Pb ages from volcanic rocks suggest that the Tielieketi, Heishantou, Molaoba, and Kalagang formations were deposited during the Famennian-Tournaisian, Tournaisian-early Bashkirian, Gzhelian, and Asselian-Sakmarian, respectively. The absence of upper Bashkirian to Kasimovian was likely caused by tectonic uplifting of the West Junggar terrane. This is compatible with the occurrence of coeval stitching plutons in the West Junggar and adjacent areas. The Junggar-Balkhash Ocean should be finally closed before the Gzhelian, slightly later or concurrent with that of other ocean domains of the southern Paleo-Asian Ocean.},

   abstract = {Detrital zircon U-Pb dating and Hf isotope analysis have been evidenced to be effective for reconstructing paleography and tectonic evolution of different continental blocks/terranes. Our new detrital zircon U-Pb and Hf isotopic results combined with literature data for the Paleozoic (meta) sedimentary rocks in the Baoshan and Lincang Blocks provide crucial constraints on the paleogeographic position and tectonic affinity of these blocks during Paleozoic times. The Lincang and Baoshan Blocks were linked with each other during Early Paleozoic times, located on the northern margins of Australia and India in Gondwana, respectively. But a rift-related ocean basin could likely have existed between these two blocks although they were still attached to East Gondwana during Middle Devonian-Early Permian times. In contrast, the Simao-Indochina Block had rifted from East Gondwana at least before the Late Ordovician as reflected by their young age cluster at similar to 450 Ma that is distinct from the characteristic Pan-African event (600-520 Ma) in Gondwana. Therefore, the Lincang Block did not represent a continental arc of the Simao Block before the Early Permian, but rather it rifted from the northern margin of Australia Gondwana in the Early Permian and subsequently as an independent block drifted northward to the west side of the Simao Block. Taken together, we propose that the Changning-Menglian Tethys Ocean was a long-lived ocean developing successively at least from the Late Ordovician to the Permian and that the southern continuation of the Lincang Block is the Inthanon zone rather than the Sukhothai zone.},

   abstract = {The Qinling Group was previously interpreted as the oldest Precambrian basement unit of the North Qinling Terrain, recording its formation and early crustal evolution. The Qinling Group consists predominantly of gneisses, amphibolites, and marbles, which underwent multi-phase deformation and metamorphism. In order to better constrain the provenance and tectonic setting of this group and the evolution of the North Qinling orogenic belt, in situ U-Pb dating and oxygen isotopic analysis of zircons in combination with whole-rock geochemistry and Sr-Nd isotope analysis was performed on the two dominant rock types, amphibolite and felsic gneiss. Felsic gneisses exhibit enrichment of LREEs and LILEs (Rb, Ba, Th, K, Pb), negative Eu anomalies and depletion of HFSEs (Nb, Ta, P, Ti). The rocks have slightly elevated delta O-18 values (6.5-9.3 aEuro degrees) and initial epsilon (Nd) values of -4.6 corresponding to two-stage Nd model age of 1.99 Ga. Amphibolites are also enriched in LILEs and LREEs and depleted in Nb and Ta and have homogeneous delta O-18 values (5.0-6.0 aEuro degrees), but higher initial epsilon (Nd) values (2.8-3.3) and younger two-stage Nd model ages (1.29-1.24 Ga) compared to the gneisses. The zircon age record indicates that the gneisses and amphibolites were formed in a similar to 960 Ma volcanic arc environment rather than in a rift setting as previously suggested. A major metamorphic event took place during the Early Paleozoic. Based on the age spectrum of detrital zircons, the Qinling Group is interpreted as an autonomous geological unit, which was mainly derived mostly from 1,000 to 900 Ma old granitoid rocks. The North Qinling Terrain can be regarded as a remnant of the Grenville orogenic belt with an early Neoproterozoic evolution different from that of the North and South China blocks.},

   abstract = {The Palaeo-Asian Ocean (PAO) was located between Siberia and the North China Craton (NCC). The time of its closure, as well as the crustal architecture of the surrounding region, are still uncertain. In this paper, we address these problems using LA-ICP-MS U-Pb ages of zircon grains in three magmatic rocks and three river sand samples of the Guyang area at the northern margin of the NCC. The magmatic rocks yield early Carboniferous crystallization ages of 340.3 +/- 7.5Ma, 331.7 +/- 2.3Ma and 341.1 +/- 1.9Ma for the main granitic pluton, a granodiorite dyke and a diorite enclave, respectively. They were the product of subduction of the PAO underneath the NCC. The detrital zircon U-Pb ages in the river sand samples are dominated by two groups at 2550-2400 and 290-260Ma, with subordinate groups at 2700-2600, 2000-1800 and 320-300Ma, dispersed Early Palaeoproterozoic grains and a minor but important group of Cretaceous grains in sands of the Aibugai River. These results, combined with previous geochronological data, permit a re-assessment of the tectonic evolution of the northern margin of the NCC. The events at similar to 2.5Ga reflect major crustal reworking and cratonization of the northern margin of the NCC, which then became a stable platform lasting until the Carboniferous. The period between 2.0 and 1.8Ga was characterized by major collisions related to formation of the Khondalite Belt and the Trans-North China Orogen. In the Carboniferous, subduction of the PAO underneath the northern margin of the NCC developed a zoned distribution of magmatic rocks. The PAO is now constrained to have closed in the Early Permian by the collision of the NCC and Siberia. The youngest group of Cretaceous zircons reflects magmatic events related to lithosphere thinning beneath the Eastern Block of the NCC. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

   abstract = {The Zha'ertai-Bayan Obo-Huade rift zone is located in the northern margin of the North China Craton (NCC), where rift-related supracrustal successions are divided into the Langshan, Zha'ertai, Bayan Obo and Huade groups from west to east. The Bayan Obo Group unconformably overlies the Late Neoarchean to Paleoproterozoic basement rocks and has been subdivided into three successions by two prominent unconformities. Depositional ages of the lower, middle and upper succession can be constrained in the period of 1.81-1.65 Ga, 1.56-1.35 Ga and 1.19-0.92 Ga respectively based on ages of the youngest detrital zircons and latter intrusions. Geochemistry of the meta-sedimentary samples suggest that most of them were directly sourced from intermediate to felsic magmatic and metamorphic rocks and only the Halahuogete samples from the middle succession display reworking features. U-Pb ages of detrital zircons from the group yielded age peaks of 2.52-2.48 Ga, 1.95-1.85 Ga, 1.74-1.61 Ga, 1.55-1.53 Ga, 1.37-1.34 Ga and 1.18-1.13 Ga. The late Neoarchean to middle Paleoproterozoic detrital zircons are documented in the lower and middle successions and are derived from the ca. 2.5 Ga Guyang and Xi Ulanbulang areas and ca.1.9 Ga Halaqin and Liangcheng areas in the Yinshan Block. The late Paleoproterozoic detrital zircons with low epsilon(Hf(t)) values from the Bilute Formation are interpreted to be sourced from the coeval rift-related granitic plutons and volcanic rocks in the northern NCC. On the other way, detrital zircon age patterns of the late Mesoproterozoic to early Neoproterozoic sedimentary units at the northern and southeastern margins of the NCC are similar with those from the western and northern margin of the Fennoscandian shield. Combined with recent paleomagnetic and geological data, we infer that the NCC and Baltica have not separated until 0.89 Ga in the Rodinia supercontinent. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

   abstract = {The Langshan area is located in the northeastern margin of the Alxa block, which is the westernmost part of the North China Craton (NCC). The Langshan Group has been divided into four formations, of which the 1st formation deposited in the period of 1.83-1.66 Ga, the 2nd and 3rd formations formed between 1.16 Ga and 0.80 Ga and the 4th formation deposited after 1.17 Ga, whereas part of the previously believed Neoarchean Alxa "Group" deposited in the period of 1.65 Ga and 1.37 Ga. U-Pb ages of detrital zircons from the Langshan Group and the early Mesoproterozoic Alxa "Group" yielded age peaks of 2.51-2.48 Ga, 2.38-2.33 Ga, 1.89-1.81 Ga, 1.79-1.62 Ga, 1.58-1.56, 1.36-1.31 and 1.18-1.17 Ga. The late Neoarchean to middle Paleoproterozoic detrital zircons are mainly documented in the 1st formation and are derived from the ca. 2.5 Ga Guyang, Xi Ulanbulang and Beidashan granitoids, ca.1.9 Ga Xuwujia, Halaqin igneous rocks and the S-type granites, and the ca. 2.32 Ga Bayanwulashan orthogneisses. The late Paleoproterozoic (1.79-1.62 Ga) detrital zircons with negative epsilon(Hf)(t) values in the Alxa "Group" are interpreted to be sourced from the coeval rift-related granitic plutons and volcanic rocks in the northern NCC. On the other way, the late Paleoproterozoic to Mesoproterozoic detrital zircons with positive epsilon(Hf)(t) values from the upper Langshan Group probably sourced from the Fennoscandian shield of the Baltica craton. Based on the similarities in the stratigraphic sequence and detrital zircon age patterns of the Changcheng, Jixian and Qingbaikou systems, we infer that the Alxa Block was still an integrated part of the NCC in the early Neoproterozoic time.},

   abstract = {The Ltiliang Complex is located at the western margin of the middle segment of the Trans-North China Orogen, along which the Western and Eastern Blocks collided to form the North China Craton. The complex mainly consists of metamorphosed granitic plutons and supracrustal rocks, of which the latter are subdivided into the Jiehekou, Ltiliang, Yejishan, Lanhe and Heichashan Groups. The Lanhe Group is composed of meta conglomerates, quartzites, and phyllites with minor meta-basalts, whereas the Heichashan Group consists of molasse-like meta-conglomerates and coarse-grained quartzites. Geochemistry of the Yejishan meta sedimentary rocks indicates weak source weathering and dominantly chemical immature features, whereas the Lanhe and Heichashan samples display opposite features. U-Pb ages of detrital zircons from the Lanhe Groups yield four age peaks at similar to 2180 Ma, similar to 2370 Ma, similar to 2520 Ma and similar to 2700 Ma. The former three peaks coincide with ages of the Chijianling-Guandishan TTG gneisses (2199-2151 Ma) and meta-volcanic rocks from the Ltiliang and Yejishan Groups (2213-2156 Ma), age of the Gaijiazhuang porphyritic gneisses (2375-2364 Ma) and age of the Yunzhongshan TTG gneisses (2499 Ma) respectively, whereas detrital zircons forming the oldest age peak were most likely derived from the early Neoarchean crust of the Eastern Block. For the Heichashan Group, the dominant 2.2-2.0 Ga detrital zircons were probably recycled from the underlying Jiehekou Group and the minority is directly derived from the early Paleoproterozoic granitoids in the Ltiliang Complex. The youngest detrital zircon age peaks of similar to 2.17 Ga and similar to 1.82 Ga place maximum depositional ages on the Lanhe and Heichashan Groups respectively, whereas the local 1.81-1.79 Ga massive granites place constraint on their minimum depositional ages. Taking into account the lithostratigraphic features, provenance and formation ages, we suggest that the Lanhe Group formed in a shrinked remnant back-arc basin and the Heichashan Group was deposited in a foreland basin. Conversion of the tectonic basin from the middle Paleoproterozoic back-arc basin to the late Paleoproterozoic foreland basin is well consistent with the model that the single collision to form the basement of the North China Craton happened at similar to 1.85 Ga.

   abstract = {The Tuolai Group dominates the Central Qilian Terrane, and there are different opinions on the age and tectonic attribute of the Tuolai Group. Based on large-scale geologic mapping and zircon dating, the Tuolai Group is divided into four parts: metamorphic supracrustal rocks, Neoproterozoic acid intrusive rocks, early-middle Ordovician acid intrusive rocks and middle Ordovician basic intrusive rocks. The metamorphic supracrustal rocks are the redefined Tuolai complex-group and include gneiss and schist assemblage by faulting contact. Zircon U-Pb LA-MC-ICP-MS dating was conducted on these samples of gneiss and migmatite from the gneiss assemblage, quartzite, two-mica schist and slate from the schist assemblage. The five detrital samples possess similar age spectra; have detrital zircon U-Pb main peak ages of 1.7 Ga with youngest U-Pb ages of similar to 1150 Ma. They are intruded by Neoproterozoic acid intrusive rocks. Therefore, the Tuolai Group belonging to late Mesoproterozoic and early Neoproterozoic. With this caveat in mind, we believe that U-Pb detrital zircon dating, together with the geologic constraints obtained from this study and early work in the neighboring regions. We suggest that the formation age of the entire crystalline basement rocks of metasedimentary sequence from the Central Qilian Terrane should be constrained between the Late Mesoproterozoic and the Late Neoproterozoic, but not the previous Paleoproterozoic. The basement of the Central Qilian Terrane contains the typical Grenville ages, which indicates the Centre Qilian Terrane have been experienced the Grenville orogeny event.},

   abstract = {Supracrustal successions in the Zhaertai-Bayan Obo-Huade rift zone on the northern margin of the North China Craton include the Zhaertai, Bayan Obo and Huade Groups from west to east. The Huade Group, which has been subdivided into four formations, is composed of basal pebbled quartzites, quartzites, schists, phyllites, marbles, slates and diopsidites. Geochemistry of the metasedimentaiy succession indicates that source rocks of the lower two formations are felsic, displaying passive margin signatures, whereas those of the upper two formations have continental island arc or active continental margin signatures. U-Pb ages of detrital zircons from the group yielded three age populations of 2690-2450, 2150-1710 and 1660-1330 Ma, of which the youngest age population only exist in the upper Huade Group. The dominant 2690-2450 detrital zircons were likely sourced from the granitic rocks in the Yinshan Block. The subordinate 2150-1710 Ma detrital zircons were probably recycled from the metasedimentary units from the Khondalite Belt and/or derived from the similar aged granitic plutons of the Hongqiyingzi "Group", which are also evidenced by the similar geochemical features of rutiles from the Huade Group and the Khondalite Belt. Minor amounts of 1660-1330 Ma detrital zircons may have derived from the North American and/or Baltica cratons connected to the northern margin of the North China Craton in the Columbia supercontinent. The youngest detrital zircon age peak of 1337 Ma in the upper Huade Group suggests that the sedimentation began after similar to 1.34 Ga. In combination with the 1320 Ma granitoids cross-cutting it, depositional ages of the upper Huade Group can be constrained between similar to 1.34 and 1.32 Ga. Taking into account the lithostratigraphic features, provenances and depositional ages, a continental rift basin deposit represented by the upper Huade Group on the northern margin of the North China Craton developed between similar to 1.34 and similar to 1.32 Ga, which indicates that the final breakup of the North China Craton from the Columbia supercontinent happened in the middle Mesoproterozoic.

   abstract = {Statherian through Tonian strata of the Langshan-Zha'ertai-Bayan Obo-Huade rift zone (LZBH) at the northern margin of the North China Craton provide an excellent record of changes in sediment provenance related to the supercontinent dispersal and amalgamation. During the late Paleoproterozoic to early Neoproterozoic, the LZBH developed over the Yinshan Block and was flanked by the Khondalite Belt to the south, the Trans-North China Orogen and Yanliao rift zone to the east, ultimately preserving a >7000-m-sequence of fluvial, marginal marine, and offshore marine sediments. In order to decipher the influence of these tectonic features on sediment delivery to the area, we evaluated 4955 U-Pb and 1616 Lu-Hf analyses from 66 samples across the entire LZBH, of which 1002 U-Pb and 271 Lu-Hf analyses from 12 samples are newly reported herein. The detrital zircon results indicate three stratigraphic intervals with internally consistent age peaks: (1) Changcheng to lower Jixian system (Statherian-lower Calymmian), (2) upper Jixian system (upper Calymmian), and (3) Qingbaikou system (Tonian). Statistical analysis of the detrital zircon results reveals two distinct changes in sediment provenance. The first transition, between the lower and upper Calymmian, reflects a provenance change from the basement of the Yinshan Block and the Khondalite Belt to a mixed signature, indicating derivation from both basement and Statherian rift-related magmatic products. Such a transition implies establishment of east-west drainage systems traversing the Paleoproterozoic Trans-North China Orogen caused by continued rifting since Statherian and pre-magmatic uplift during breakup of the North China Craton from the Columbia supercontinent. The second transition is indicated by the presence of Mesoproterozoic detrital zircons with juvenile Hf isotopic features since Tonian time and the up-section and northward increase of Mesoproterozoic detrital zircons. Their provenance is interpreted to be the Fennoscandian shield by a pancontinental drainage system related to aggregation of the Rodinia supercontinent. Thus, the detrital zircon spectra in the LZBH document the transition from initial unroofing of local uplifted basement of the Yinshan Block and Khondalite Belt to the distant Yanliao rift zone, then to the more distant Fennoscandian shield.},

The youngest detrital zircon age peaks in the Luohandong and Wuzhiling Formations constrain their maximum depositional ages at similar to 2350 Ma and similar to 1960 Ma, respectively. In combination with the 1775 Ma undeformed granitoids that cut the Songshan Group, the depositional age of the Songshan Group can be constrained in the period between similar to 2350 and similar to 1780 Ma. Considering the lithostratigraphic feature, provenance and depositional age, the Songshan Group is interpreted as having deposited in a retroarc foreland basin, which is consistent with the model that the collision between the Eastern and Western Blocks to form the Trans-North China Orogen occurred at similar to 1.85 Ga after long-lived subduction.

   abstract = {Since the Late Cenozoic, the Tian Shan area, as for most ranges in continental Asia is rejuvenated by the far-field effects of the India-Asia collision. However, the tectonic processes that affected the area prior to the Cenozoic are still poorly known, especially in the South Tian Shan block. An extensive record of this earlier tectonic history is provided by the thick Paleozoic to Mesozoic sedimentary sequences preserved in the Kapushaliang and Heiyingshan sections in southern Tian Shan. U-Pb (LA-ICP-MS) dating of detrital zircons from eight sandstone samples from these two close sections ranging in age from latest Paleozoic to Early Mesozoic is used to investigate changes in sediment provenance through time and to correlate them with major tectonic phases in the range. The results show that the detrital zircons are mostly magmatic in origin, with some minor metamorphic input. The U-Pb detrital zircon ages range widely from 224 to 3320 Ma and can be statistically divided into four main groups: 224-250 Ma (4%), 251-380 Ma (40%), 380-520 Ma (35%) and 545-3320 Ma (21%). Data analysis associated to already published sedimentary and geochronology information indicate that the zircons were largely derived from the Tian Shan area to the north since the Permian initiation of the basin. From latest Paleozoic to Early Mesozoic, the sediment provenance and basin-range pattern evolution of South Tian Shan can be generally divided into two stages: (1) during Early Permian, the South Tian Shan basin was in a half-graben most probably post-orogenic extensional context. (2) From Late Permian to Early Jurassic times, the South Tian Shan became a passively subsiding basin, with a geographically wider source area characterized by a relatively low topography.

   abstract = {The Upper Permian to Triassic sedimentary successions of the southern Junggar Basin and western Turpan Basin are characterized by widespread unconformities. However, the origin of these unconformities remains highly controversial. Three sections, namely the Jimsar section in the southern Junggar Basin and the Aiweiergou and Yuergou sections in the western Turpan Basin, have been systematically studied using detrital zircon U-Pb geochronology, heavy mineral assemblages, and whole-rock geochemical analyses. Detrital zircon ages show that both Upper Permian and Triassic samples from each section have similar age distributions, with a major age group at 250-380 Ma, a subordinate age group at 380-540 Ma, and sporadic Precambrian ages, suggesting that the main provenance areas were the North Tian Shan and the northern margin of the Yili-Central Tian Shan, with a secondary source area in the Yili-Central Tian Shan. REE distributions and trace element crossplots also indicate that Upper Permian and Triassic samples display similar characteristics in both basins; all were sourced from felsic or mixed mafic/felsic rocks, with only a minor component of ancient or recycled sediments. Detrital provenance and geochemical analyses agree in showing no significant changes in the source-to-sink sediment transport system from the Late Permian to the Triassic. However, field observations, heavy minerals analysis, and geochemistry do suggest that both the southern Junggar Basin and western Turpan Basin experienced an arid climate during this interval. Both Upper Permian and Triassic sediments in the two basins contain abundant hematite, display low CIA values and Th/U ratios, and have mudcracks, redbeds, and other indicators of arid climate. Therefore, we suggest that the regional unconformities in the two basins were not generated by regional tectonic uplift, but most likely resulted from an increasingly arid climate.

   abstract = {The Lower to Middle Permian terrestrial successions in the southern Junggar and Turpan basins provide a wealth of information regarding the paleoclimatic and paleogeographic evolution of mid-latitude NE Pangea. Two sections, namely the Xiaolongkou section in the southern Junggar Basin and the southwest (SW) Tarlong section in the Turpan Basin, were systematically studied using detrital zircon geochronology and whole-rock geochemical analysis. Stratigraphic studies suggest that, in both sections, the Lucaogou and Hongyanchi formations are dominated by lacustrine deposits, while the Quanzijie Formation represents mixed fluvial-lacustrine and loess environments. The Lucaogou Formation displays low CIA (Chemical Index of Alteration) values and Th/U ratios, suggesting semiarid to arid conditions in both sections. The Hongyanchi Formation shows low to intermittently moderate CIA values and Th/U ratios, indicating variably semiarid-arid conditions alternating with subhumid-semiarid episodes. The lower part of the Quanzijie Formation reflects subhumid-semiarid to semiarid arid conditions, while the upper part of the Quanzijie Formation mainly records semiarid-arid and shifts into subhumid conditions toward the top. Detrital zircon and element data indicate that, within each section, all three formations display similar zircon age distributions and geochemical characteristics, suggesting no significant changes in provenance during deposition. However, the provenance characteristics of the two sections differ from each other; the Xiaolongkou section is rich in felsic material, with two detrital zircon age peaks, while the SW Tarlong section contains more mafic components, with a single peak in detrital zircon age spectrum. This suggests that the greater Junggar-Turpan Basin was highly partitioned with several independent provenance systems active during the Early-Middle Permian. The abrupt change in depositional environments in both sections may have resulted from uplift of the North Tian Shan, which induced rapid regression of the lakeshore and uplift of sediment source and catchment areas.},

   abstract = {Early Cretaceous sedimentary rocks in the Sulu Orogen (SO) have been a popular topic in recent years. The provenances of sedimentary rocks can help elucidate the tectonic history of the SO, China. The Dingzi Bay and Taolin areas in the SO have always been poorly known. Thus, we date detrital zircons from four sedimentary rock samples including sandstone, siltstone, and greywacke collected in both areas. Age distributions from Dingzi Bay exhibit three major age populations including Palaeoproterozoic (1900-1800 Ma), Neoproterozoic (800-700 Ma), and Early Cretaceous (136-106 Ma) ages and small age populations including early Mesozoic, Palaeozoic, and Palaeoproterozoic-Archean ages, while age distributions in the Taolin area show the largest age population of Early Cretaceous (132-102 Ma) with minor early Mesozoic, Palaeozoic, and Neoproterozoic populations. The youngest detrital zircon populations yield weighted mean ages of ca. 116 Ma in Dingzi Bay and ca. 120 Ma in the Taolin area as the maximum depositional ages, which correspond to the Early Cretaceous Lower Qingshan Group. Age distributions in both areas indicate that the local SO served as the primary source area, whereas the Yangtze Block might have been a lesser source of detrital zircons. The comparison of geochronological, geochemical, and sedimentary data among Dingzi Bay, Taolin, Laoshan, and Lingshan Island suggests an Early Cretaceous marine basin formed over the SO. Further, considering previous regional tectonic history, we propose a two-stage (Laiyang and Qingshan stages) evolutionary model for this marine basin. We suggest that transpression between the Laiyang and Qingshan stages due to subduction of the Pacific Plate might have caused rapid uplift of the south-eastern SO and closing of the marine basin. Correspondingly, this process influenced the input of the source material from the Yangtze Block to the marine basin during the Qingshan stage.},

   abstract = {The U-Pb and Lu-Hf isotopic research of detrital zircons was carried out in southern modern rivers of the South Tianshan (STS) orogenic belt to understand the accretionary processes and crustal evolution in this region. Detrital zircons from river sands yield two dominant age populations at 460-390 Ma and 310-260 Ma with several Precambrian age groups. Such age patterns imply that the significant magmatic events occurred during the Palaeozoic in the STS. Comparative studies on U-Pb age of the detrital zircons from northern and southern river sands in the STS belt provide constraints on the tectonic evolution of the STS belt and its surrounding blocks. Abundant 500-460 Ma detrital zircons in northern river sands probably reflect a bidirectional subduction of the Palaeozoic Central Tianshan Ocean under the Yili Block and the Central Tianshan Block. The 460-390 Ma zircon population in both northern and southern river sands likely implies a bidirectional subduction of the South Tianshan Ocean. A lack of the 380-320 Ma zircon grains in the southern river sands may indicates the northward subduction of the South Tianshan Ocean. A final collision between the Tarim Craton and the south-western Central Asian Orogenic Belt possibly took place in the Late Carboniferous; the 310-260 Ma zircon population in both northern and southern river sands suggests syn- and post-collisional magmatism. Based on the Hf isotopic signatures in the detrital zircon and magmatic zircons, we propose new constraints on the Palaeozoic crustal evolution of the STS. The continent formation in the STS belt was characterised by reworking of the ancient crust in a compressional environment during the Ordovician (ca. 460-440 Ma). Abundant significant juvenile materials progressively added to the crust through time in an extensional tectonic regime since Late Ordovician to Devonian (ca. 440-390 Ma). The crustal formation is mainly dominated by reworking of the Precambrian basement rocks with limited contribution of juvenile components input into magma formation during Late Carboniferous to Early Permian (ca. 310-260 Ma).},

   abstract = {Variation in zircon trace element (TE) and isotopic composition data have been used to infer changes in global-scale processes; however, few studies have explored zircon TE data as a comprehensive means to track regional shifts in tectonic regimes. In this contribution, we explore the utility of zircon TE data to record the well-documented Late Paleozoic-Mesozoic tectonic history in Southeast Asia, which includes transitions from continental magmatism to island-arc extension, subsequent compression and island-arc accretion, and finally continental collision. We present new U-Pb ages, along with Lu-Hf isotopic and TE data, from 2,478 detrital zircon grains extracted from 17 modern river sediment samples collected across two major suture zones in Thailand. Our results show that zircon Th/U and Nb/Ta mean values increase after similar to 300 Ma, whereas the percentage of classified 'felsic' zircon decline corresponding with the initiation of Nan back-arc basin extension and isolation of the Sukhothai Arc from Indochina. From similar to 255 to 235 Ma, zircon epsilon Hf-(t), LREE/HREE, (Eu/Eu*)(N) , (Ce/Ce*)(N), Nb/Ta, and Th/U mean values decline, whereas Dy/Yb, U/Yb, and the proportion of classified S-type and 'felsic' zircon increase, showing the transition from I-type to S-type, and from more juvenile to more evolved magmatism. This transition reflects a shift from arc extension to compression via the closure of the Nan back-arc basin and the collision of the Sukhothai Arc with western Indochina, and the subsequent collision of Sibumasu with the Sukhothai Arc demarking the regional closure of the Paleo-Tethys ocean. Our data also show linear correlations between epsilon Hf-(t)-DM and trace elemental data, particularly (Eu/Eu*)(N) , that reflect increasing sediment contamination within the melts. Lastly, our data illustrate that the Sibumasu-Sukhothai Arc collided similar to 20 million years earlier in Thailand than in the Malay Peninsula, demonstrating along-strike diachroneity in Paleo-Tethys closure. Thus, time-integrated detrital zircon TE data may reliably track subduction slab dynamics and tectonic evolution beyond U-Pb and Hf isotope data alone. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {The Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB) is one of the largest accretionary orogens in the world. It was formed mainly by amalgamation of island arcs, accretionary wedges and microcontinents. Revealing the origins of the Precambrian continental blocks is essential for the understanding of the tectonic framework and geodynamic evolution of the CAOB. In this paper we present detrital zircon U-Pb ages of Precambrian meta-sedimentary rocks and late Paleozoic undeformed sandstone from the northern Yili Block, Chinese North Tianshan, in order to better understand the regional tectonic evolution. Two mica-schist samples from the Wenquan Metamorphic Complex (WMC) show similar zircon age distribution patterns with peaks at similar to 0.43 Ga, similar to 0.54 Ga, similar to 0.65-0.68 Ga, similar to 0.74-0.79 Ga, similar to 0.89-0.92 Ga, similar to 1.3-1.55 Ga and similar to 1.69-1.70 Ga, respectively. Minor age peaks of similar to 1.1 and similar to 2.2 Ga are also separately recognized in individual samples. A phyllite from the Mesoproterozoic Changcheng System yielded detrital zircon ages mainly ranging from 855 to similar to 1500 Ma with a single peak at similar to 906 Ma. According to the analysis of age data and corresponding CL images of the dated zircon grains, protoliths of the mica-schists and phyllite should have deposited later than 645 Ma and 850 Ma, respectively, and were subjected to medium- to low-grade metamorphism during mid-late Silurian time. The good agreement between the age patterns of the meta-sediments and those of the nearby granitic and high-grade metamorphic rocks of the WMC indicates that the detrital zircon grains were mainly derived from the local metamorphic/crystalline basement. Occurrence of much older zircons (similar to 1.0-2.2 Ga) in the mica-schists and absence of such zircon populations in the phyllite suggest that (1) the protoliths of the mica-schists and phyllite had distinct sources and were deposited at different time, and (2) Mesoproterozoic to Paleoproterozoic rocks probably existed in the northern Yili Block. Three undeformed sandstone samples yielded consistent single age peak at similar to 368-376 Ma and contain only a few Proterozoic detrital zircon grains. The peak age is in agreement with ages of neighboring late Paleozoic arc magmatic rocks in the Chinese North Tianshan. Thus, the sandstone was probably deposited during latest Devonian to earliest Carboniferous time in a forearc or interarc basin, around which Proterozoic basement was not exposed or completely isolated. A comparison between the zircon age patterns of the northern Yili Block and the surrounding cratons and microcontinents leads us to conclude that (1) the northern Yili Block had a Proterozoic basement similar to that of the Chinese Central Tianshan and Kyrgyz North Tianshan, and (2) these microcontinental blocks share the same origin as the Tarim Craton, but are distinguished from the Siberian Craton.

   abstract = {The South Qinling Belt, incorporating the northern margin of the Yangtze Block, South China Craton, records a series of Neoproterozoic to Triassic cycles of ocean opening and closing. The Neoproterozoic Suixian Group provides a record of breakup of the Rodinia supercontinent. New zircon U-Pb ages, Hf isotopes and whole-rock elemental data from the group constrain the broader tectonic evolution of the South Qinling Belt and the position of South China within Rodinia. The Suixian Group comprises sandstone and siltstone associated with minor interlayered volcanic rocks. Detrital zircons show three U-Pb age peaks at similar to 2450 Ma, similar to 1990 Ma and similar to 750 Ma, with a minimum age of similar to 700 Ma. Their epsilon Hf(t) values range from -22.5 to + 11.1. Zircon U-Pb and Hf isotopic data are similar to the age range and Hf isotopic character of magmatic zircons from the Precambrian igneous rocks in the South Qinling Belt, which in combination with the euhedral to subhedral apperance of the detrital zircons, suggests local derivation from rock units within the belt. The sedimentary rocks from the Suixian Group have high La/Sc (0.91-7.28), Th/Sc (0.56-2.16) and low Cr/Th ratios (0.94-5.28), implying derivation from felsic volcanic rocks. Their elemental contents and ratios are similar to those accumulating in a continental arc environment. Similarly, the detrital zircons from the late Neoproterozoic sedimentary rocks along the margins of the Yangtze Block show a dominant U-Pb age peak of 770 Ma to 710 Ma, suggesting significant input from an approximately syn-depositional magmatic source. The Neoproterozoic detrital zircons show similar age distributions and epsilon Hf(t) values to those of the Neoproterozoic igneous rocks around of the Yangtze Block, suggesting that these sedimentary rocks were sourced from a magmatic arc. The Yangtze Block and northern India preserve similar Neoproterozoic sedimentary successions and detrital age populations indicating that they were closely connected and located along either the margin of Rodinia or on a plate isolated from Rodinia.},

Three newly identified Mesoproterozoic magmatic intervals at 1.76-1.60 Ga, 1.53-1.37 Ga, and 1.25-1.05 Ga, were accompanied by three mineralization events at 1.65 Ga, 1.45 Ga, and 1.05 Ga. These events are also recorded by detrital zircon from ca. 1.05 Ga equivalent sedimentary sequences in both western Yangtze and central Hainan Island. These findings indicate a common Proterozoic tectonic history shared by central Hainan and Yangtze, contradicting models invoking Grenvillian-aged tectonism in South China. The Yangtze Block occupied an intracratonic position (between Laurentia and Australia) in Nuna, before it drifted away and docked to Western Australia and northern India in the reconfigured Rodinia. The Cathaysia was located close to northern India during the Proterozoic.},

   abstract = {The Zhifu Group exposed in the northeastern Jiaobei Terrane is subdivided from base to top into the Laoyeshan, Bingying and Dongkou formations, and comprises mainly quartzites and muscovite- and tourmaline-bearing quartz schists. In order to define its provenance and depositional age, and to constrain the crustal growth and recycling of the source regions, we have conducted LA-ICP-MS U-Pb dating and in situ Hf isotopic study of detrital zircons from three quartz schists samples collected from the Zhifu Group. Most of the analyzed zircon grains have oscillatory zoning and Th/U ratios >0.4, suggesting igneous origins. 270 detrital zircons U-Pb analyses yield U-Pb ages of 1709-3679 Ma that cluster into three major age populations of 1.7-1.9 Ga with a peak at 1844 Ma, 1.9-2.0 Ga with a peak at 1936 Ma and 2.4-2.55 Ga with a peak at 2465 Ma, and two minor age populations of 2.2-2.35 and 2.6-2.7 Ga. The peaking age of 1844 Ma for the youngest age population indicates that the Zhifu Group must be deposited after 1844 Ma. Detrital zircons with ages of 1.7-2.35 Ga can be linked to pre- and post-tectonic polyphase magmatic events along the JLJB, and most of the zircons have negative epsilon(Hf(t)) values from +1.76 to -18.02 and two-stage Hf model ages (T-DM2) concentrating at similar to 2.7-3.0 Ga, indicating that source rocks of these zircons were derived from recycling of ancient crusts. Detrital zircons with ages of 2.4-2.9 Ga may have been sourced from the Archean granitoid (mainly TTG) gneisses in the Jiaobei Terrane, and these zircons have epsilon(Hf(t)) values from +6.4 to -7.53 and T-Dm2 of 2.6-3.4 Ga (peak at similar to 2.7-3.0 Ga), suggesting that source rocks of these zircons were mainly derived from juvenile crusts associated with a major crustal growth at similar to 2.7-3.0 Ga, and a limited amount of ancient crustal component. The two detrital zircons with ages of 3631 and 3679 Ma have negative epsilon(Hf(t)) values of -4.42 and -1.51 and T-Dm2 of 4137 and 4000 Ma, respectively, implying the recycling of ancient continental crust (>3.6 Ga) and crustal growth prior to 4.1 Ga in the NCC.

   abstract = {Early Mesozoic Basins in the Yanshan FoldThrust Belt (YFTB), located along the northern margin of the North China Craton (NCC), record significant intraplate deformation of unknown age. In this article, we present evidence for the rapid exhumation of high-grade basement rocks along the northern margin of the NCC in the Early Mesozoic. UPb geochronology of detrital zircons constrains the maximum depositional ages of syntectonic sedimentary units that formed during the unroofing of basement rocks and plutons in the Xiabancheng Basin. In the Early Mesozoic, the Xiabancheng Basin recorded a dramatic transformation in depositional environments, related to a significant change in the regional tectonic setting. In this study, the tectonic evolution of the YFTB is established from paleocurrent data and UPb zircon ages of sandstone and granitic gravels of the Xingshikou Formation, Xiabancheng Basin. The paleocurrent direction of meandering fluvial facies in the Triassic Liujiagou and Ermaying Formations are from east to west. In contrast, the overlying Xingshikou Formation consists of alluvial fan facies with paleocurrent directions from north-northwest to south-southeast. The lower and middle segments of the Xingshikou Formation record rapid exhumation of basement rocks along the northern margin of the NCC. U-Pb ages of detrital zircons within the Xingshikou Formation are characterized by three major UPb age groups: 2.22.5 Ga, 1.71.8 Ga and 193356 Ma. From 193 Ma to 356 Ma, a subsidiary peak occurs at 198 +/- 5 Ma, constraining the sedimentation age of the Xingshikou Formation to the Early Jurassic. Zircon from the Wangtufang pluton in the northern portion of the Xiabancheng Basin yields UPb ages of 191 +/- 1 Ma and 207 +/- 1 Ma. Within error, these crystallization ages are identical to detrital zircon ages of 206 +/- 1 Ma and 206 +/- 2 Ma obtained for granitic gravel clasts in the Xingshikou Formation. Thus, the Wangtufang pluton and surrounding basement rocks must have experienced rapid uplift and exhumation during the Early Jurassic. The onset of exhumation along the northern margin of the NCC occurred at ca. 198180 Ma.},

The age spectra, variations in U and Th contents, Th/U ratios and Hf isotopic compositions of the detrital zircons of the Penglai Group are identical to those of the Tonian strata of the southeastern NCC. The Penglai Group rocks also have a similar litho- and biostratigraphy and tectonic setting to these Tonian strata, suggesting that the Penglai Group has a tectonic affinity with the NCC and was deposited during the Tonian. The detrital zircon age populations of the Penglai Group are consistent with the multiple magmatic and thermal metamorphic events in the NCC, especially the 1300-1000 Ma intermediate-acid and/or acid igneous rocks of the Korean Peninsula, and we therefore propose that the Penglai Group is mainly sourced from the NCC. The detrital zircon populations of 1300-1000, 1500-1300, 1700-1500 and 1800-1700 Ma show both positive and negative epsilon(Hf(t)) values, which, combined with late Paleoproterozoic-Neoproterozoic basic magmatism represented by large volumes of diabase sills in the NCC, suggests that the NCC experienced strong crust-mantle interactions that might have triggered continuous, multi-stage rifting in the NCC during the late Paleoproterozoic (1.8 Ga)-Neoproterozoic.},

   abstract = {The Wulian complex is located on the northern margin of the Sulu orogenic belt, and was formed by collision between the North China Craton (NCC) to the north and South China Craton (SCC) to the south. It consists of the metasedimentary Wulian Group, gneissic granite and meta-diorite. The U-Pb analyses for the detrital zircons from the Wulian Group exhibit one predominant age population of 2600-2400 Ma with a peak at c. 2.5 Ga and several secondary age populations of > 3000, 3000-2800, 2800-2600, 2200-2000, 1900-1800, 1500-1300 and 1250-950 Ma; some metamorphic zircons have metamorphic ages of c. 2.7, 2.55-2.45, 2.1-2.0 and 1.95-1.80 Ga, which are consistent with magmatic-metamorphic events in the SCC. Additionally, the Wulian Group was intruded by the gneissic granite and meta-diorite at c. 0.76 Ga, attributed to Neoproterozoic syn-rifting bimodal magmatic activity in the SCC and derived from partial melting of Archaean continental crust and depleted mantle, respectively. The Wulian Group therefore has tectonic affinity to the SCC and was mainly sourced from the SCC. The detrital zircons have positive and negative epsilon(Hf)(t) values, indicating that their source rocks were derived from reworking of both ancient and juvenile crustal rocks. The major early Precambrian crustal growth took place during c. 3.4-2.5 Ga with a dominant peak at 2.96 Ga and several secondary peaks at 3.27, 2.74 and 2.52 Ga. The two oldest zircons with ages of 3307 and 3347 Ma record the recycling of ancient continental crust (> 3.35 Ga) and crustal growth prior to c. 3.95 Ga in the SCC.},

   abstract = {The late Mesozoic magmatism and associated ore deposits were extensively developed in the southern Great Xing'an Range (SGXR), northeastern China. The geodynamic evolution of the SGXR during the late Mesozoic, however, remains controversial. Here, we present new detrital zircon U-Pb and Hf isotopic data of the Late Cretaceous sandstones of the Yaojia and Qingshankou formations from the southwestern Songliao Basin, aiming at constraining their provenance and the late Mesozoic geotectonic evolution of the SGXR. The detrital zircon U-Pb ages of the sandstone samples display similar distribution patterns and mainly fall into two groups (i.e., 267-223 Ma and 169-122 Ma), indicating that they may have a common source area. Furthermore, these zircons have epsilon Hf (t) values similar to those of the magmatic rocks in the SGXR and northern North China Block (NCB). Integrated with zircon morphology, zircon U-Pb and Hf isotope indicate that both the SGXR and northern margin of the NCB (limited to the southwest of the Songliao Basin) have provided a dominant provenance for the Yaojia and Qingshankou formations. Similar age distribution patterns and the youngling age trend of the late Mesozoic igneous rocks from the SGXR to the northern margin of the NCB indicate that the Late Jurassic-early Early Cretaceous magmatism in the study area was associated with the evolution of the Mongol-Okhotsk Ocean. In addition, the age distribution patterns, distinct variability of zircon Th/U ratios and development of A-type granites, volcanic rocks, and metamorphic core complexes demonstrate that the SGXR and northern margin of the NCB have undergone an extensional process since middle Late Jurassic. We therefore propose that the middle Late Jurassic-early Early Cretaceous magmatism in the SGXR and adjacent northern margin of the NCB was associated with an extensional regime induced by collapse or delamination of thickened continental crust corresponding to the closure of the Mongol-Okhotsk Ocean.},

   abstract = {Sedimentary rocks provide key information on source-to-sink systems and the regional expression of plate tectonics. The abruptly changing provenance signature of sedimentary rocks is commonly ascribed to changes in the source regions, such as continental collision events, the rise of mountain chains, reorganization of river systems and climatic change. However, moving the positions of the sinks (depocenters) geographically can also change the provenance record, but this is rarely considered. Typically, large-scale strike-slip faults can transport depocenters for long distances, thus altering the provenance information. In this study, we present a systematic investigation of the provenance changes in the Sikhote-Alin orogenic belt in the Russian Far East to evaluate this process. The Central Sikhote-Alin Fault is a margin-parallel strike-slip fault that developed along the NE Asian continental margin from the late Mesozoic. Our new detrital zircon U-Pb data, together with a compilation of geochronological data, indicate two different types of provenance signatures available: the sediments to the west of the fault were mainly derived from the adjacent Central Asian Orogenic Belt, but to the east of the fault, they were mainly supplied from the Korean Peninsula, which is several hundred kilometers away. It is proposed that these different sedimentary rocks were juxtaposed by syn- and post-subduction sinistral displacements along the fault, and were not related to local variations in the source regions. Thus, understanding the shifting positions of depocenters is important when decoding provenance change because lateral displacement is critical for reconstructing regional paleogeography along oblique convergent plate margins.},

   abstract = {The Sikhote-Alin orogenic belt in Russian Far East is comprised of several N-S trending belts, including the Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous accretionary prisms and turbidite basin which are now separated by thrusts and strike-slip faults. The origin and collage of the belts have been studied for decades. However, the provenance of the belts remains unclear. Six sandstone samples were collected along a 200km long east-west traverse across the major belts in the southern Sikhote-Alin for U-Pb dating and Lu-Hf isotope analysis to constrain the provenance and evaluate the evolution of the northwest Pacific margin at this time. The result reveals that the sediments from the main Samarka belt was mainly from the adjacent Bureya-Jiamusi-Khanka Block (BJKB); the eastern Samarka belt and the Zhuravlevka turbidite basin were supplied by detritus from both the North China Craton (NCC) and the BJKB; the Taukha belt was mainly fed by sediments from the NCC; whereas the data from the Sergeevka nappes are insufficient to resolve their provenance. In the Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous, collision and subduction was important in the initial collage of most belts in Sikhote-Alin. However, merely E-W trending collage cannot explain the increasing importance of the NCC provenance from west to east. It is proposed that the main Samarka belt was located adjacent to the BJKB when deposited, whereas the other belts were farther south to accept the materials from the NCC. Sinistral strike-slip faulting transported the eastern belts northward after their initial collage by thrusting.},

   abstract = {The North China Craton (NCC) represents one of only a few cratonic nuclei on the globe with a geological history extending back to the Eoarchean. However, extensive ca. 2.5 Ga crustal reworking has destroyed a considerable portion of the pre-existing crustal record, hindering the investigation of tectonothermal evolution prior to 2.5 Ga. The Huoqiu Complex (HQC), located at the southeastern margin of the NCC, preserves the vestiges of crustal components that survived the ca. 2.5 Ga tectonothermal events, which provide the opportunity to investigate the Meso- to Neoarchean episodic crustal evolution of the NCC. Here we present results from in-situ detrital zircon U-Pb dating and Hf isotope analyses on zircons from three paragneisses in three drill cores that cut through the basement of the HQC. In combination with published data, the concordant age spectra of the detrital zircons in the paragneisses yield Pb-207/Pb-206 ages of 2343-3997 Ma that cluster into two principal age populations with peaks at 3015 and 2755 Ma. One zircon grain dated at 3997 +/- 8 Ma with 98% concordance provides new evidence for 4.0 Ga components in the NCC. The epsilon(Hf)(t) values of all zircons range from -5.2 to +6.5, with most of the spots (n = 31 of 47) showing positive values, indicating at least two episodes of juvenile continental crustal growth at 3.01 Ga and 2.75 Ga. The older episode is recorded only in few ancient cratons, suggesting limited crustal accretion occurred globally at a time of subdued mantle-derived magmatism. In contrast, the younger episode is coincident with a global rise in magmatic activity in the early Neoarchean. The geochemical and geochronological data suggest that the 3.01 Ga juvenile crust was likely generated in an island-arc subduction system, whereas the 2.75 Ga crustal rocks were probably formed during magmatic underplating and subsequent partial melting of lower crustal mafic rocks. Consequently, a tectonic transition is suggested from a compressive to an extensional setting along the southeastern margin of the NCC between 3.01 and 2.75 Ga. This sequence of events heralds a shift, from a mixture of net crustal growth and crustal reworking during multiple short-lived magmatic pulses, to fragmentation and dispersal of the early continental nucleus within 260 Ma.

This study focused on U-Pb ages and Hf isotopes of detrital zircons from early Paleozoic sedimentary rocks in the Central Altyn Tagh terrane. Our dating results revealed that the studied sedimentary rocks were deposited at ca. 467-429 Ma. The predominant early Paleozoic detrital zircons demonstrate negative epsilon(Hf)(t) values, highlighting their derivation from the coeval intermediate-felsic magmatic rocks sourced from ancient supracrustal materials with enriched isotopes. These inferred, enriched intermediate-felsic magmatic rocks were probably generated in different consumption and closure processes of the North and South Altyn Oceans, based on geochronology and geochemistry of the early-middle Paleozoic intermediate-felsic magmatic rocks in the Altyn Tagh orogen. A number of ca. 520-490 Ma detrital zircons were primarily derived from the coeval, enriched intermediate-felsic magmatic rocks in the local Central Altyn Tagh terrane and the adjacent North Altyn Tagh subduction-accretion belt associated with the advancing subduction of the North Altyn Ocean. The ca. 490-470 Ma detrital zircons are most prominent and suggest a derivation from the coeval, enriched magmatic rocks subject to the rollback of the North Altyn Ocean. These inferred magmatic rocks might have once existed in the region but have been intensely exhumed to be source material for the studied sedimentary rocks. A few ca. 450 Ma detrital zircons indicate a provenance from the North Altyn Tagh subduction-accretion belt during collision after the final closure of the North Altyn Ocean. In contrast, some ca. 470-460 Ma detrital zircons were probably derived from the coeval intermediate- to felsic-magmatic rocks in the Central Altyn Tagh terrane during the exhumation stage of the deep continental collision after the final closure of the South Altyn Ocean. Combination of provenance study and magmatic record provides potential to establish complicated orogenic evolution.},

   abstract = {The main site and timing of the final closure of the middle segment of the Paleo-Asian Ocean (PAO) has been an issue of hot debate, which hampers us from better understanding the late-stage tectonic evolution of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB). Synthesizing the available geological records for the ophiolitic melanges in the Beishan Orogenic Belt (BOB), we regard the Liuyuan ophiolitic melange as the main site of the final closure of the middle segment of the PAO. To determine the final closure time of the middle segment of the PAO, this study mainly applied field-based, systematic zircon U-Pb-Hf isotopic analyses for the Carboniferous and Permian sedimentary successions on the northern and southern sides of the Liuyuan ophiolitic melange. Our results indicate that the late Carboniferous sedimentary successions north of the Liuyuan melange consisting mainly of interbedded sandstone and siltstone with minor conglomerate show primarily affinity with a local, single source, i.e. the constituent units of the BOB north of the Liuyuan melange. They were closely associated with the northward subduction of the middle segment of the PAO. By contrast, the unconformably overlying Permian clastic deposition on both sides of the Liuyuan ophiolitic melange shows comparable lithology that fines from a thick sequence of conglomerate at the base to thin-bedded turbidite sequences up section. These Permian units were probably deposited in a progressively deepening basin within an extensional post-collision regime after the disappearance of the middle segment of the PAO. All the <274-261 Ma sandstones on both sides of the Liuyuan ophiolitic melange were derived from commingling source regions on both sides of the Liuyuan melange, as supported by comparable, diagnostic ages and epsilon(Hf)(t) values between the studied detrital zircons and coeval magmatic zircons from the BOB and north Tarim. Such a marked transition from a single, local provenance in the late Carboniferous to commingling provenances at ca. 274-261 Ma indicates the final closure of the middle segment of the PAO prior to the end of the early Permian. In conjunction with available data for the eastern and western segments of the PAO, we establish the eastward-younging, scissor-like closure for the whole PAO during mid Carboniferous to Early Triassic time.

   abstract = {Much controversy exists regarding the timing of the final closure of the Paleo-Asian Ocean and the resultant formation of the Central Asian orogenic belt. The Yagan and Zhusileng-Hangwula arcs in northern China, generally considered as the eastern extension of the Beishan orogenic belt, occupy the key junction between the South Tianshan suture to the west and the Solonker suture to the east, but they nonetheless have received little attention. The well-preserved Carboniferous-Triassic volcanosedimentary successions in the Yagan and Zhusileng-Hangwula arcs provide an ideal location at which to constrain the closure time of the middle segment of the Paleo-Asian Ocean. This forms the focus of this study, in which systematic field-based zircon U-Pb-Hf isotopic and whole-rock elemental analyses were employed.
Our results reveal that the Carboniferous strata are likely marine deposits consisting mainly of clastic rocks interfingering with volcanic rocks and minor cherts and limestones. The 330-310 Ma sandstones were dominantly sourced from the local Yagan and Zhusileng-Hangwula arcs, the adjacent Beishan orogenic belt and southern Mongolia, and the eastern Central Asian orogenic belt. The associated 330-311 Ma andesites and rhyolites suggest a continental arc setting, probably owing to northward subduction of the Paleo-Asian Ocean. The subsequent clastic deposition of the Lower Permian section fines from conglomerates and sandstones at the base to interbedded sandstones and siltstones at the top, characteristics of shallow-marine successions. The interlayered 286-283 Ma volcanic interlayers from the Lower Permian indicate the further northward subduction of the Paleo-Asian Ocean. Up section, most of the Upper Permian strata are characterized by thick successions of marine clastic and volcanic rocks. The increasing age abundance in the late Paleozoic and the markedly negative epsilon(Hf)(t) values of the Early Permian detrital zircons in the 276-269 Ma sandstones suggest an augmented supply of detritus from the Alxa terrane to the south of the Paleo-Asian Ocean. This implies that initial closure of the Paleo-Asian Ocean occurred at ca. 276 Ma. Comparatively, in the 266-263 Ma sandstones, the striking increase in early Paleozoic detritus and the considerable spread of negative epsilon(Hf)(t) values for the 1.1-0.8 Ga detrital zircons more likely indicate derivation from the Beishan orogenic belt and/or southern Mongolia or the eastern Central Asian orogenic belt and subsequent transport to the northern Paleo-Asian Ocean. Such a fluctuating detrital supply to the north and south sides of the Paleo-Asian Ocean can be interpreted as a result of the continuous closure of the Paleo-Asian Ocean, involving latest consumption processes between 276 Ma and 263 Ma, as also evidenced by the associated 274-263 Ma volcanic arcs recognized in the Upper Permian. By contrast, the top of the Upper Permian to the Lower Triassic section consists of pebbly conglomerates and coarse-grained sandstones, representing alluvial-fluvial sedimentation, in which sandstones with depositional ages between 256-254 Ma and 230 Ma were probably derived from the local areas. Accordingly, a depositional transition from marine to terrestrial and a provenance shift from multiple source regions to a local detrital provenance can be inferred to have occurred in the end-Permian to Early Triassic, reflecting uplift of the Yagan and Zhusileng-Hangwula arcs during the period subsequent to the disappearance of the Paleo-Asian Ocean. Together with other lines of geological evidence in the area, we infer that the final closure of the middle segment of the Paleo-Asian Ocean occurred between the end of the Early Permian and the Early Triassic. In conjunction with available data for the eastern and western segments of the Paleo-Asian Ocean, we proposed a scissor-like closure model for the whole Paleo-Asian Ocean, in which its western, middle, and eastern segments were closed at 320-300 Ma, 280-265 Ma, and 260-245 Ma, respectively.},

   abstract = {The location of the Tarim craton during the assembly and breakup of the Rodinia supercontinent remains enigmatic, with some models advocating a Tarim-Australia connection and others a location at the heart of the unified Rodinia supercontinent between Australia and Laurentia. In this study, our new zircon U-Pb dating results suggest that middle Neoproterozoic sedimentary rocks in the Altyn Tagh orogen of the southeastern Tarim craton were deposited between ca. 880 and 760 Ma in a rifting-related setting slightly prior to the breakup of Rodinia at ca. 750 Ma. A compilation of existing Neoproterozoic geological records also indicates that the Altyn Tagh orogen of the southeastern Tarim craton underwent collision at ca. 1.0-0.9 Ga and rifting at ca. 850-600 Ma related to the assembly and breakup of Rodinia. Furthermore, in order to establish the paleoposition of the Tarim craton with respect to Rodinia, available detrital zircon U-Pb ages and Hf isotopes from Meso- to Neoproterozoic sedimentary rocks were compiled. Comparable detrital zircon ages (at ca. 0.9, 1.3-1.1, and 1.7 Ga) and Hf isotopes indicate a close linkage among rocks of the southeastern Tarim craton, Cathaysia, and North India but exclude a northern or western Australian affinity. In addition, detrital zircons from the northern Tarim craton exhibit a prominent age peak at ca. 830Ma with minor spectra at ca. 1.9 and 2.5 Ga but lack Mesoproterozoic ages, comparable to the northern and western Yangtze block. Together with comparable geological responses to the assembly and breakup of the Rodinia supercontinent, we offer a new perspective of the location of the Tarim craton between South China and North India in the periphery of Rodinia.},

   abstract = {The evolution of the northern margin of Gondwana, especially to the north of India and Australia, remains enigmatic. Much controversy concerns when and where the Tarim craton was amalgamated with northern Gondwana due to final closure of the North and South Altyn Oceans (two branches of the Proto-Tethys Ocean between south-eastern Tarim and northern Gondwana). This study addressed these issues through systematic field-based zircon U-Pb dating and Hf-isotope analyses of early Paleozoic sedimentary rocks in the Altyn Tagh orogen. New dating results reveal depositional ages from ca. 494 to 426 Ma. Provenance tracing indicates the ca. 494-477 Ma samples were dominantly sourced from local Altyn Tagh areas to the south of the North Altyn Ocean, whereas the ca. 465-449 Ma samples are characterized by a significant increase in ca. 2.7-2.4 Ga, 2.0-1.7 Ga, and 840-780 Ma detrital zircons, indicating an augmented supply of detritus from the Tarim craton to the north of the North Altyn Ocean. This change indicates a major provenance shift from a single to multiple source regions between ca. 477 and 465 Ma, marking the timing of the final closure of the North Altyn Ocean. Zircon U-Pb and Hf-isotopic data from the ca. 444-426 Ma samples resemble those from the ca. 465-449 Ma samples, suggesting local sediment recycling related to a postcollisional regime. Considering the South Altyn Ocean and other branches of the Proto-Te-thys Ocean, we infer that the entire Proto-Tethys Ocean might have been progressively closed at ca. 500-420 Ma, leading to the amalgamation of most East Asian blocks with northern Gondwana. Detrital zircon U-Pb and Hf-isotope comparisons indicate that Tarim shared a North Indian affinity with many East Asian terranes (such as North Qilian, North Qinling, South China, Indochina, South Qiangtang, etc.), rather than with Arabia-Iran or other terranes (e.g., Lhasa and Sibumasu) that were adjacent to western Australia along the northern margin of Gondwana.},

   abstract = {The theory of plate tectonics suggests that deformation occurs mainly along plate boundaries; however, compression can result in the formation of orogens and basins within intracontinental settings. During these two tectonic processes, the sedimentation and environmental changes occur in response to marginal and intracontinental deformation. Early Jurassic - Early Cretaceous deformation and basin formation along the Qinling orogenic belt and the northwestern Sichuan Basin in central-SW China are ideal for investigating a reactivated tectonic belt and basin formation. We studied the Lower Jurassic - Lower Cretaceous sedimentary sequences and structures along the northwestern margin of the Sichuan Basin, and obtained detrital zircon U-Pb ages for these rocks. The structures show that deformation migrated SE-wards and S-wards into the Sichuan Basin along the Longmen Shan, Micang Shan and Daba Shan tectonic belts during middle-late Mesozoic time. The Lower Jurassic oligomictic conglomerates have a smaller grain size and thicken towards the south, indicating protracted transport from a northern source. The conglomerates deposited near-source record post-orogenic south-vergent thrusting during the Late Triassic - Early Jurassic epochs. The Lower Cretaceous conglomerates and sandstones have multiple sources, which indicate that they were rapidly deposited near their source, synchronous with thrusting that occurred in response to coeval SE-wards and S-wards thrusting in the Longmen Shan and Daba Shan tectonic belts during the Late Jurassic - Early Cretaceous epochs. Detrital zircon grains from the Lower Jurassic - Lower Cretaceous sedimentary rocks yielded age peaks of 2600-2200, 1850-1600, 850-700, 540-400, 250-180 and 180-140 Ma. A comparison of these ages with those of surrounding exposed rocks indicates that the sediments in the northwestern Sichuan Basin were supplied from the Qinling orogenic belt, the northwestern Yangtze Block, the south margin of the North China Block and the Songpan-Garze Terrane. The youngest peaks of detrital zircon U-Pb ages at 207 and 159 Ma constrain the two stages of intracontinental shortening and highlight the link between intracontinental deformation and sedimentation.},

   abstract = {The Xunhua, Guide and Tongren intermontane basin system in the NE Tibetan Plateau, situated near the Xining basin to the N and the Linxia basin to the E, is bounded by thrust fault-controlled ranges. These include to the N, the Riyue Shan, Laji Shan and Jishi Shan ranges, and to the S the northern West Qinling Shan (NWQ). An integrated study of the structural geology, sedimentology and provenance of the Cenozoic Xunhua and Guide basins provides a detailed record of the growth of the NE Tibetan Plateau since the early Eocene. The Xining Group (ca. 5221 Ma) is interpreted as consisting of unified foreland basin deposits which were controlled by the bounding thrust belt of the NWQ. The Xunhua, Guide and Xining subbasins were interconnected prior to later uplift and damming by the Laji Shan and Jishi Shan ranges. Their sediment source, the NWQ, is constrained by strong unidirectional paleocurrent trends towards the N, a northward fining lithology, distinct and recognizable clast types and detrital zircon ages. Collectively, formation of this mountainbasin system indicates that the Tibetan Plateau expanded into the NWQ at a time roughly coinciding with Eocene to earliest Miocene continental collision between India and Eurasia. The Guide Group (ca. 211.8 Ma) is inferred to have been deposited in the separate Xunhua, Guide and Tongren broken foreland basins. Each basin was filled by locally sourced alluvial fans, braided streams and deltaic-lacustrine systems. Structural, paleogeographic, paleocurrent and provenance data indicate that thrust faulting in the NWQ stepped northward to the Laji Shan from ca. 21 to 16 Ma. This northward shift was accompanied by EW shortening related to nearly NS-striking thrust faulting in Jishi Shan after 1113 Ma. A lower Pleistocene conglomerate (1.81.7 Ma) was deposited by a through-flowing river system in the overfilled and connected Guide and Xunhua basins following the termination of thrust activity. All of the basinmountain zones developed along the Tibetan Plateau's NE margin since IndianTibetan continental collision may have been driven by collision-induced basal drag of old slab remnants in the manner of N-dipping and flat-slab subduction, and their subsequent sinking into the deep mantle.},

   abstract = {Eolian deposition in China is intimately related to Asian desertification. The fine-grained sediments in the Cenozoic basins along the northeastern Tibetan Plateau are increasingly reported as eolian deposits due to their loess-like characteristics, thus extending the onset time of Asian desertification from the late Miocene to the early Miocene. However, the basin-scale stratigraphic correlation and geographic origin of these fine-grained sediments remain poorly investigated, limiting any interpretation of the transportation and paleoclimatic conditions responsible for their emplacement. This study combines analyses of detrital zircon U-Pb geochronology and heavy-mineral assemblages to present the first comprehensive stratigraphic and provenance study of Miocene sediments in the Tianshui Basin in northeastern Tibet. Comparison of results from 64 sand-sized and silt-sized samples from various sedimentary beds across the basin reveals that the main stratigraphic packages can be correlated basin-wide, confirming that the silt-sized sediments were a natural part of the basin fill. Statistical visualizations of the large data set from northern and western China clearly shows that the West Qinling Mountains are the main source of the Tianshui Basin silts. Contribution estimates corroborate this conclusion and eliminate the likelihood of substantial contributions from other mountains and drylands. Moreover, the significant differences between the Tianshui Basin silts and the Chinese Loess Plateau/Red Clay are reflected by their heavy-mineral compositions and euhedral zircon U-Pb ages. These provenance analyses strongly contradict the previous assumption of desert origin for the Tianshui Basin silts. Moreover, the northward transport of the Tianshui Basin silts conflicts with the prevailing dust pathway driven by the Asian westerlies and winter monsoons, which do not support the eolian interpretation for their formation. Consequently, we suggest that the Miocene Tianshui Basin silts cannot be used as an indicator of extensive desertification, in contrast with the suggestions of previous studies. This proposal undermines the corresponding hypothesis of an early Miocene onset of Asian interior desertification, and further raises questions about the validity of prevalent paleoclimatic interpretations drawn from fine-grained basin sediments.},

   abstract = {The deformation of the Tibetan Plateau is central to unraveling the process and mechanism of continental tectonics. Although most agree that crust shortening and plateau growth were protracted throughout the Cenozoic Indo-Asian collision, particular deformation histories relating to tectonic kinematics and dynamics are still incomplete due to sparseness of diagnostic geological information from plateau margin. Here we present combined investigation of stratigraphy, magnetostratigraphy, and provenance for the eastern margin of Longzhong Basin to show two reorganizations of basin formation and tectonic regime during the late Tertiary. First, the depocenter migrated from the dispersed Paleogene sequences to the Wushan-Tianshui foreland sequence during the earliest Miocene (circa 22Ma), accompanied by shift of sedimentary provenance from double sources including the eastern Qilian block and eastern West Qinling terrain to single source within the West Qinling. It suggests reorganization of deformation from NW-SE extension to NE-SW contraction and initial uplift of the eastern West Qinling. Second, massive coarse-grained fluvial beds were revived in the Wushan Basin during the late Miocene (circa 10Ma), associated by eastward depositional expansion and another shift of sedimentary provenance toward northeast. It reflects thrusting up of the northern edge of the West Qinling and Liupan Shan Mountains linked with relocation of crust shortening from NE-SW direction to ENE-WSW direction and accelerated deformation of northeastern Tibet. These transitions of deformation regimes imply variation of geodynamic mechanisms during the process of plateau growth.},

Our isotopic ages constrain the timing of initiation of the Yanliao rift as ca. 1680 Ma.

However, the Mesoproterozoic sequence in the Mianchi-Queshan areas, which is represented by the Ruyang Group, exhibited significantly different characteristics with influx of much younger zircons. The southern Yan-Liao and Mianchi-Queshan areas showed distinct similarity in the stratigraphic pattern, reflected by the Mesoproterozoic successions in these two areas being both bracketed by two sequence boundaries and further divided into two sequences under a uniform sea-level change. The Mesoproterozoic strata in these two areas probably possessed a correlative relationship in the stratigraphic patterns and basin evolutionary history.},

   abstract = {Controversial issues on the Paleo-Mesoproterozoic tectonic setting of the southern margin of North China Craton (NCC) restricted our understanding of its role in breaking up the Columbia/Nuna Supercontinent. Existing models are still arguing on whether the southern margin was an intra-continental rift or active continental margin. Previous studies mainly focused on the magmatic records in the Paleoproterozoic Xiong'er Group, while the overlain sedimentary series and their depositional nature and the related tectonic environment were not yet well constrained. In this study, we scrutinized the comprehensive geochronological and geochemical dataset for the Mesoproterozoic sedimentary rocks along the southern margin of NCC. Our new results, together with the previous geochemical data show that the interior part of NCC southern margin (e.g. Wufoshan Group of the SongJi area) is dominated by the materials from the mature continental crust. Approaching the marginal area of southern NCC (e.g. Gaoshanhe and Guandaokou Groups of the Xiaoqinling-Luanchuan area), sediments are more enriched in magmatic arc fragments and unfractionated materials. Detrital zircon geochronological results revealed a progressive younging tendency from the northern Song-Ji to southern Xiaoqinling-Luanchuan areas. Together with the newly-reported zircon hafnium data, the synthesized dataset in this study favors the hypothesis that the southern NCC during the Paleo-Mesoproterozoic was in an active continental arc setting under a prolonged peripheral subduction regime, which was surrounding the marginal areas of the Columbia/Nuna Supercontinent.},

   abstract = {The Great Unconformity between the Precambrian basement and the Phanerozoic successions marks a major gap in the stratigraphic records globally. However, previous studies on the time, magnitude, and the spatial distribution of this unconformity in the North China Craton (NCC) mainly focused on the south-eastern margin and were seldom investigated in the central area. In this study, we report detrital zircon geochronological data of the Huoshan Formation, a siliciclastic stratigraphic unit between the Archean-Palaeoproterozoic metamorphic basement and Cambrian successions in the central NCC. The youngest age peak of 685 Ma suggests that the Huoshan Formation was formed in the post-Ediacaran rather than the counterpart of the lower Palaeo-Mesoproterozoic Changcheng Group. The detrital zircons of the quartz sandstone from the Huoshan Formation show varied age populations of 2,700-2,600 Ma, 2,600-2,500 Ma, 2,200-2,000 Ma, 1,900-1,800 Ma, and 700-600 Ma, which correspond to typical tectono-thermal events of the NCC. First, the widely developed Precambrian tectono-thermal events in the NCC were archived in the detrital zircons in the Huoshan Formation, for instance, the crustal growth event at 2,600-2,500 Ma and the 1,850-1,800 Ma magmatic and metamorphic events. Second, the age peaks younger than 1,000 Ma are not distinct in the NCC and are possibly from other terranes. The Great Unconformity represented by the boundary between the Huoshan Formation and the underlying Archean-Palaeoproterozoic basement suggested a high topography and long-term denudation in the Luliang area during the transition from the Proterozoic to the Phanerozoic.},

   abstract = {Detrital zircon U-Pb age and Hf isotope studies are useful for identifying the chemical evolution of the continental crust. Zircon, however, is typically a magmatic mineral and thus often fails to document the timing of low-grade metamorphism, and its survival through multiple sedimentary cycles potentially biases the crustal evolution record toward older events. In contrast, monazite typically records metamorphic events and is less likely to survive sedimentary recycling processes, thus providing information not available by zircon. Here, we demonstrate that monazite apparently faithfully records the Sm-Nd isotope composition of the bulk rock and can therefore track the record of crustal evolution and growth, similar to Hf isotopes in zircon. We examine the utility of detrital zircon and monazite for studies of crustal evolution through a comparison of age and tracer isotope information using sediments from two large rivers draining the South China block (SCB). Monazite and zircon grains yield mostly Mesozoic and Paleozoic U-Pb ages and depleted mantle model age peaks at ca. 1900-1300 Ma, indicating that both minerals preserve similar, yet critical, information on the crustal evolution of the catchment area. In contrast, zircon yields abundant Neoproterozoic and older U-Pb ages with a very large spread of model ages, preserving a history strongly skewed to older ages. Based on the lack of known rocks of this age in the catchments, ancient zircon was likely sourced from sedimentary rocks within the catchment area. This combined data set presents a more complete history of crustal evolution and growth in the SCB and demonstrates the advantages of an integrated approach that includes both detrital monazite and zircon.},

   abstract = {Many previous studies have investigated the late Palaeozoic ophiolites, migmatites and high-pressure metamorphic belts of the Tibetan Plateau, whereas the early Palaeozoic evolution of the regions is relatively poorly understood. Lower Palaeozoic strata, including the Duguer quartz schist, occur in the Himalaya, Lhasa and South Qiangtang terranes of the Tibetan Plateau. In this study, we report the depositional age and sedimentary provenance of the Duguer quartz schist of the central South Qiangtang terrane, which enables us to interpret the tectonic affinity of the terrane. We obtained U-Pb ages, trace-element compositions and Hf isotopic data from zircons from the Duguer quartz schist. A total of 162 U-Pb analyses of detrital zircons from the schist yielded two pronounced age peaks at c. 600 Ma and c. 960 Ma. These results indicate that the provenance of the Duguer quartz schist is India Gondwana or the terranes that share an affinity with India Gondwana in the Tibetan Plateau, which include the South Qiangtang and Himalaya terranes. Detrital zircon crystals show large variations in Hf isotope compositions, with epsilon(Hf)(t), T-DM and T-DM(C) values of -52.5 to 13.2, 900-3300 Ma and 1010-4240 Ma, respectively. This suggests that the source area for the Duguer quartz schist included Precambrian rocks and, more specifically, Pan-African and Grenville-Jinning crustal material. During Pan-African and Grenville-Jinning events, crustal recycling and the addition of mantle material occurred in the source regions of the quartz schist, when the South Qiangtang, Lhasa and Himalaya terranes were all part of the northern margin of Gondwana.},

   abstract = {Detrital zircons are often used to constrain the maximum sedimentary age of strata and sedimentary provenance. This study aimed at reconstructing the Cryogenian palaeogeography of the Yangtze Domain based on U-Pb ages and Lu-Hf isotopic signatures of detrital zircons from sandstones in the southeastern part of the Yangtze Domain. U-Pb ages of the youngest detrital zircon grains from the Niuguping, Gucheng and Datangpo formations yielded average ages of 712 +/- 24 Ma, 679.2 +/- 6.2 Ma and 665.1 +/- 7.4 Ma, respectively, which are close to the depositional ages of their respective formations. An integrated study of detrital zircon Lu-Hf isotopes and U-Pb ages from three samples revealed six main peak ages in the samples from the Anhua section at c. 680 Ma, c. 780 Ma, c. 820 Ma, c. 940 Ma, c. 2000 Ma and c. 2500 Ma. The characteristics of the U-Pb ages and Hf isotopes indicate a link between the north and southeast margins of the Yangtze Domain as early as c. 680 Ma, and the provenance of the coeval sedimentary sequences in the SE Yangtze Domain was the South Qinling Block on the northern margin of the Yangtze Domain. The provenance analysis on the c. 680 Ma detritus composing upper Neoproterozoic strata in the Yangtze Domain revealed that the detritus was transported southward from South Qinling to the southeast margin of the Yangtze Domain through the Exi Strait, but was hindered by the Jiangnan Orogenic Belt.},

The results show that the sedimentary rocks were mostly sourced from active continental margins. The detrital zircon ages of the Sunjiagou and Liujiagou formations spread from >3,000 to 250 Ma with peaks of main age populations at 2,508, 1,890, 430, and 270 Ma. Based on the age comparison and the southward palaeocurrents, we consider that the source material of these sedimentary rocks comes from the northern margin of the NCC. This in turn indicates that the amalgamation of the PAO and the NCC should have finished at least by the end of the Late Permian.},

   abstract = {Upper Triassic turbidites in the eastern Tethyan Himalaya preserve archives for early-stage evolution of the Neo-Tethys. However, their provenance and tectonic setting remain controversial. Here we report petrographic, detrital zircon U-Pb and trace element data of newly discovered sandstones interbedded with layered basalts and whole-rock geochemical data of basalts from the Yumen melange within Upper Triassic turbidites, and the same types of published data from associated terranes in the eastern Gondwana are compiled for comparison. The interbedded sandstones are dominated by quartz, lithics fragments and plagioclase grains, resembling those of the Langjiexue Group. All samples display similar ranges of detrital zircon U-Pb ages, with significant age populations at 280-210 Ma, 650-450 Ma and 1200-800 Ma, comparable to those of the Langjiexue Group and coeval turbidites from Western Myanmar and partly from Central Tethyan Himalaya, implying they should share identical provenance. Trace elements of 300-200-Ma-aged zircons indicate they were derived from a continental magmatic arc. Geochemical data from interbedded basalts display typical within-plate-basalt affinity. Synthesized with regional geological setting, the above observations suggest Upper Triassic turbidites from Eastern and part of Central Tethyan Himalaya, and Western Myanmar were deposited in a marine rift basin of Indian passive continental margin with their primary provenance from Lhasa. However, other contemporaneous turbidites from part of Central Tethyan Himalaya and Australia had distinct primary sources from Indian continent and West Papua, respectively, indicating they may have separate deposystems.},

   abstract = {The Chinese Altai, a typical region of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB), has been envisaged as subduction-accretion complex or Precambrian microcontinent. Thick metasedimentary rocks crop out extensively in the Central Altai and Qiongkuer domains, but their depositional age is not well constrained. Most workers have regarded these sedimentary rocks as passive continental margin sediments deposited on a Precambrian microcontinent. However, our studies of U-Pb and Hf isotopes of detrital zircons separated from these rocks reveal that a predominant population has 206 Pb/238 U ages between 460 and 540 Ma and most grains of this population possess positive e Hf(t) values. Zircons of the population have oscillatory zoning, possess high Th/U ratios, and are enhedral to subhedral crystals with sharp edges, showing short distance of transportation from an igneous provenance. The above results indicate that these metasedimentary rocks were deposited on an active continental margin not prior to the Middle Ordovician. Therefore the Chinese Altai orogen was an active continental margin in the Early Paleozoic, which is inconsistent with a Precambrian microcontinent model and reveals an arc accretionary history.},

   abstract = {Precambrian geology of the Tarim Craton, especially for the crustal evolution, is poorly constrained. Paleoproterozoic metasedimentary rocks are extensively exposed in the Kuluketage Block, northern Tarim Craton, and thus have recorded abundant geological information of its tectonic history. Supracrustal rocks within the Archean basement (Tuoge Complex) and the Paleoproterozoic Xingditage Group were collected from the Kuluketage Block for geochemical study and zircon U-Pb dating. The Tuoge supracrustal rocks have low CIA values between 45 and 63, indicating weak chemical weathering. Although the Xingditage Group shows a large variation of CIA values (37-67), their low average value suggests that they underwent similar weathering to the rocks from the basement. This similarity is also supported by their respective PIA values (mostly 43-57 for the basement rocks, and mostly 37-60 for the Xingditage Group). The high ICV values (mostly >1) of both rock suites indicate an immature source that lacked alumina-rich minerals. Although these metasedimentary rocks show different REE patterns, they are all enriched in light rare earth element (LREE) and display relatively flat heavy rare earth element (HREE) patterns. The low values of ferromagnesian (e.g. Cr, Co and Ni) and high field strength elements (e.g. Zr, Hf, Nb, Ta and Y) are similar to those of graywackes from active continental margins. Therefore, the Kuluketage Block most likely evolved in an active continental margin setting during the late Paleoproterozoic. Detrital zircons from a slate sample of the Tuoge supracrustal rocks are dominated by igneous zircons, which mostly yield Paleoproterozoic 207pb/206Pb ages between 1.72 Ga and 2.08 Ga. Other igneous grains give Paleoproterozoic 207Pb/206Pb ages at 2.2 Ga and 2.32 Ga. All these igneous zircons show large variations of eFif(t) values mostly between 17 and 3, and have Neoarchean crustal model ages (TDm =2.6-3.7 Ga). Schist and quartzite samples of the upper Xingditage Group show similar age spectra to the slate and contain a major igneous zircon population with Paleoproterozoic formation ages (mostly 1.8-2.1 Ga) and Paleo- to Mesoarchean Tpmc ages (2.7-3.1 Ga). A schist sample of the lower Xingditage Group shows a much different age spectrum. Detrital zircons from this sample are dominated by Neoarchean grains (2.5-2.7 Ga) with Paleoarchean ibmc ages (3.14-3.51 Ga) and two of them yield the youngest ages at 1.94 and 2.09 Ga. The youngest zircons from these samples, therefore, define the maximum depositional ages at 1.63, 1.94 and 1.77 Ga for the Tuoge supracrustal rocks, the upper Xingditage Group and the lower Xingditage Group, respectively. On basis of these age spectra, we suggest that the Tuoge supracrustal rocks are equivalents of the upper Xingditage Group, instead of parts of the Archean basement. Overall, the Hf isotopic compositions of these detrital zircons indicate three early Precambrian crustal growth events in the Tarim Craton, which occurred in the late Paleoarchean, the early Neoarchean and at the beginning of the Paleoproterozoic. 2015 Elsevier B.V.

   abstract = {Neoproterozoic metavolcanic-sedimentary sequences are well preserved along the southwestern margin of Tarim Craton, NW China. In order to constrain the depositional timing of the metasedimentary sequences and better understand the crustal evolution, we present new detrital zircon U-Pb ages and Hf isotopic data for the Neoproterozoic metasediments collected from the eastern Aliankate Group in the southwestern Tarim Craton (STC). The detrital zircons are characterized by high Th/U ratios, clear concentric zoning and euhedral shapes, which imply that the metasediments of the Aliankate Group were mainly derived from a proximal magmatic source. The U-Pb dating of the detrital zircons from three samples shows similar age spectra with an overwhelming population of early to middle Neoproterozoic ages. Zircons from this Neoproterozoic population of the three samples yielded uniform youngest peak age at 790-808 Ma, respectively, indicating the maximum depositional age of the eastern Aliankate Group. Based on the published age data of detrital zircons, we suggest that the Aliankate Group most likely deposited at 776-790 Ma. Because of the slightly different main age peaks, we also suggest that the Neoproterozoic source materials for the eastern and western of this group may be different although they were both derived from a Neoproterozoic source. The crustal Hf model ages of the Aliankate detrital zircons yield three distinct populations with peaks at 2.13-2.20 Ga, similar to 2.81 Ga, and similar to 3.03 Ga, respectively. In combination with the previous published data, we suggest that the southwestern Tarim Craton experienced similar crustal evolution to the northern in the Archean, especially for the earliest three crustal growth events at similar to 3.6 Ga, similar to 3.0 Ga, and similar to 2.8 Ga, but much different since the early Paleoproterozoic. Therefore, we suggest that the southwestern and northern Tarim Craton have uniform Archean basement and likely separated from each other in the early Paleoproterozoic.},

   abstract = {The tectonic affinity of the terranes and microcontinents within the Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB) remains controversial. The Altai-Mongolian terrane (AMT), as a representative tectonic unit in the Mongolian collage, plays a vital role in reconstructing evolution history of the CAOB. The well-preserved early Paleozoic sedimentary sequence covering in this terrane could be considered as a fingerprint to track its provenance and tectonic affinity. Here, we present new whole-rock geochemistry, detrital zircon U-Pb dating, and Hf isotopic analysis for the metasedimentary rocks from the Mongolian Altai in order to shed new light on the tectonic affinity of the AMT. The youngest detrital zircon ages and the regional intrusions constrain the depositional time of the Mongolian Altai sequence to between Late Silurian and Early Devonian, which is consistent with the Habahe group in the western Chinese Altai. The features of whole-rock geochemistry and the cumulative distribution curves of the detrital zircon age spectra indicate that the Mongolian Altai sequence was probably deposited in an active continental setting during early Paleozoic. The zircon age spectra of our samples are all characterized by a main age group in the early Cambrian (peak at 541 Ma, 522 Ma, 506 Ma and 496 Ma, respectively), subdominant age populations during the Tonian, as well as rare older zircons. The nearby Lake Zone of Ikh-Mongol Arc most likely provided plenty of early Paleo-zoic materials, the subdominant Neoproterozoic detrital zircons could be supplied by the felsic intrusions along the western margin of the Tuva-Mongol microcontinent, and the sparse older zircons may be derived from its basement material. The Precambrian age distribution of the AMT is quite similar to both the Tarim and Siberia cratons, but the Siberia Craton displays a closer resemblance in Hf isotopic composition with the AMT. Thus, we believe that the Siberia Craton contains a closer tectonic affinity with the AMT, and that the Tuva-Mongol microcontinent possibly rifted from the western margin of this craton after the Tonian. To the south of the AMT, recent studies indicated the Yili and Central Tianshan blocks in the Kazakhstan collage of the western CAOB likely have a closer affinity with Gondwana. Therefore, the microcontinents in the CAOB most likely derived bilaterally from both the Siberia Craton and the Gondwana supercontinent. Moreover, our Hf isotopic compositions indicate two significant continental growth events in the Tonian and early Paleozoic, respectively.},

   abstract = {Subduction-accretion complexes occur widely in the Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB). Due to the scarcity of fossils, the depositional timing of the Habahe flysch sequence of the subduction-accretion complex in the Chinese Altai is poorly constrained, which gave rise to much controversy in understanding the time of the basement and the tectonic evolution of the Chinese Altai. U-Pb dating of detrital zircons from the Habahe sequence in the northwestern Chinese Altai reveals a young zircon population with a mean Pb-206/U-238 age around 438 Ma which, together with a mean Pb-206/U-238 age of 411 +/- 5 Ma for the overlying rhyolite of the Dongxileke Formation, brackets the time of deposition of the sequence between early Silurian and early Devonian. The age of the Dongxileke rhyolite also indicates that the overlying Baihaba Formation possibly began to be deposited in the early Devonian, though U-Pb dating of detrital zircons from this formation gave a maximum depositional age of similar to 438 Ma. The youngest detrital zircons and metamorphic grains of the Habahe sequence reveal different provenance to the sequence in the east. The youngest and metamorphic zircon grains, with early Paleozoic, Neoproterozoic and pre-Neoproterozoic populations, suggest a multi-source for the Habahe sequence. The predominantly early Paleozoic zircons, characterized by concentric zoning, high Th/U ratios and euhedral shapes, imply that the sediments of the sequence were mostly derived from a proximal magmatic source. Based on the age patterns of the Neoproterozoic and pre-Neoproterozoic populations, the Tuva-Mongol Massif, along with adjacent island arcs and metamorphic belts, may be an alternative source region for the Habahe sequence. In view of new geochemical and chronological data for granitoids and advancement in the study of regional metamorphism in the Chinese Altai, we suggest a tectonic model of subduction beneath a huge subduction-accretion complex for the evolution of the Chinese Altai in the early Paleozoic.

   abstract = {Determining the provenance of sedimentary basin fill in the northern Qaidam Basin is a key step toward understanding the sedimentary system dynamics and mountain-building processes of the surrounding orogenic belts in Tibet. The exceptionally thick (average of 6-8 km) Cenozoic fluvio-lacustrine deposits in the northern Qaidam Basin were once thought to have been eroded from the nearby northern Qaidam Basin margin and the southern Qilian Shan and to reflect the prolonged thrust-related exhumation of these orogenic belts. However, several recent studies, based mainly on paleocurrent and detrital zircon U-Pb age data, suggested that they were derived from the distant East Kunlun Shan to the south, or the Qimen Tagh to the southwest (at least 200 and 350 km from the northern Qaidam Basin, respectively). That model assumed that the East Kunlun Shan and Qimen Tagh formed significant topographic barriers during the earliest sedimentation of Cenozoic strata (e.g., the Lulehe Formation) in the northern Qaidam Basin. Therefore, the tectonic significance of the provenance of the Lulehe Formation remains a fundamental problem in understanding the postcollisional uplift history of the northern Tibetan Plateau. To address this issue, we conducted sedimentological and paleocurrent analyses of the Lulehe Formation and detrital zircon U-Pb dating of Mesozoic strata in the northern Qaidam Basin. The results, in combination with existing paleocurrent and seismic reflection data, collectively indicate that although the source area cannot be specified by matching zircon U-Pb ages in sedimentary rocks with crystalline basement source rocks, other evidence points consistently to a unified proximal northerly source area (the northern Qaidam Basin margin and the southern Qilian Shan). Our results emphasize that noncrystalline basement rocks (e.g., Mesozoic sedimentary rocks) in fold-and-thrust belts should be taken into consideration when seeking potential source areas by correlating zircon U-Pb ages of siliciclastic detritus with related basement rocks. In addition, this study strongly supports the claim that variations in the proportions of age populations should be used with caution when determining source terrane by comparisons of age distributions.},

   abstract = {The present Yangtze Block was proposed to be formed as a unified block in the Mesoproterozoic-Neoproterozoic transition, but the detailed timing and process are poorly constrained. Here we report integrated in situ U-Pb and Hf-O isotopic analyses of detrital zircons from the Xiaoxikou metamorphosed sedimentary rocks of the Miaowan Complex in the Yangtze Block, as well as U-Th-Pb and Nd-O isotopic analyses of magmatic monazites from an undeformed and unmetamorphosed leucocratic vein intruding these metasedimentary rocks. U-Pb dating results for detrital zircons from the metasedimentary rocks display two main age peaks at ca 970 and 900 Ma. The 970 Ma zircons are dominantly characterized by mantle-like delta O-18(zir) values (4.5-5.8 parts per thousand) and highly depleted epsilon(Hf)(t) values (+ 5 to + 14). The 900 Ma zircons mostly have O and Hf isotopic features similar to the 970 Ma zircons, except relative small proportion of grains with high delta O-18 values (6.0-9.2 parts per thousand) and variable epsilon(Hf)(t) values (-33 to + 7). Monazites from the vein are dated at ca 850 Ma and have uniform delta O-18 values (5.4-6.6 parts per thousand), but significantly enriched epsilon(Nd)(t) values (-14.5 to -12.6). Based on the new isotopic results and immature lithology, the Xiaoxikou metasedimentary rocks are interpreted to be deposited between 900 and 850 Ma in a fore-arc basin, and clastic materials derived from ca 970-900 Ma arc rocks were related to the northward subduction (present-day coordinates) of the Miaowan oceanic plate. The 850 Ma leucocratic vein shows geological and isotopic characteristics consistent with local 860-840 Ma post-tectonic granitic plutons, and may represent a fractionated product of local coeval granitic magmas. We propose that the closure of the Miaowan oceanic basin and formation of the current unified Yangtze Block occurred between 900 and 860 Ma, i.e., later than the deposition of the fore-arc metasedimentary rocks while earlier than the emplacement of the post-tectonic plutons.},

   abstract = {The blueschist-bearing Aksu Group and the associated rocks in the Aksu-Wushi area play a crucial role in understanding Neoproterozoic tectonic evolution of the Tarim Craton. However, the age and tectonic setting of the Aksu Group, and its relationship with the Qiaoenbrak Formation, remain controversial. Previous studies were mainly focused on the well-known Aksu Group from the Aksu area, but little attention has been paid to the equivalent rocks from the Wushi area. In this paper, we present the first detrital zircon LA-ICP-MS U-Pb ages for the Aksu Group metasedimentary rocks from the Wushi area, and we also measure U-Pb ages for detrital zircons from the Qiaoenbrak Formation to figure out its affinity to the Aksu Group. Our data show that the protolith of the metasedimentary rocks of the Aksu Group from the Wushi area was deposited between ca. 790 and 761 Ma, which was earlier than that from the Aksu area (>ca. 750 Ma). The Qiaoenbrak Formation was deposited between ca. 780 and 744 Ma, probably contemporaneous with or earlier than the metasedimentary rocks of the Aksu Group. Geochemical data for the metasedimentary rocks of the Aksu Group from the Wushi area suggest that they were deposited in an arc-related setting. Combining the detrital zircon age spectra and geochemistry analyses, we propose that the sedimentary rocks of the Aksu Group and the Qiaoenbrak Formation were probably deposited in a similar tectonic setting related to an active continental margin in the northern margin of the Tarim Craton. The Aksu blueschists and the associated Neoproterozoic arc were probably related to the circum-Rodinia subduction system, rather than assembly of the Rodinia or Gondwana in the interior of the supercontinents.

Here, we present U-Pb ages and Hf isotope compositions of detrital zircons from five metasedimentary rocks and one monzogranite within the Jiamusi Massif, and our aim was to constrain the depositional ages and provenance of the strata, as well as the tectonic affinity of the massif. Two specimens of two-mica schist from the Upper and Lower Kimkanskaya groups (Russian Far East) yielded zircon age populations at 572, 826, 891, 958, and 1776 Ma, and 682, 752, 835, and 925 Ma, respectively; a sericite schist and muscovite schist from the Majiajie Group (NE China) yielded zircon age populations at 951, 1232, 1419, 1643, and 2687 Ma, and 1151, 1276, 1444, 1623, 1805, and 2652 Ma, respectively; and a two-mica schist from the Ximashan Formation of the Mashan Group (NE China) yielded zircon age populations at 994, 1281, 1439, 1647, and 1805 Ma. Taking into account the general geological relationships in the area, zircon age populations, and Hf isotopic compositions, combined with an age of 492 Ma for a monzogranite that intrudes the Ximashan Formation, we conclude that the Lower Kimkanskaya Group formed in the Neoproterozoic and was sourced mainly from a Neoproterozoic terrane, whereas the Majiajie Group and Ximashan Formation formed in the Neoproterozoic but were sourced dominantly from a Mesoproterozoic terrane. Taking into account previous paleomagnetic data, our dating results and comparisons with zircon age populations in Precambrian rocks from northeastern Gondwana and the southern Siberia, North China, and Tarim cratons, suggest that the Jiamusi Massif has an affinity with the Tarim Craton.

   abstract = {The uplift history of northeastern Asian continental margin has been the subject of much debate. The Sanjiang Basin is an ideal area to investigate the uplift history of this margin. We present new data from sandstone petrology, whole-rock geochemistry, U-Pb geochronology and Hf isotopy of detrital zircons to trace the provenance of the basin and to unravel the uplift history of the northeastern Asian continental margin. We investigated the chemical and plagioclase indices of alteration and index of compositional variability (CIA, PIA and ICV, respectively) in samples from two formations. The geochemical proxies indicate that source rocks were subjected to an intensified weathering process. Based on the high SiO2/Al2O3 values and low K2O, we infer that the two basinal strata experienced silicification and insignificant potassium metasomatism. Sandstone petrography is indicative of low degrees of sedimentary sorting, suggesting a proximal deposition. The provenance fingerprints of light rare earth, high-field-strength and transition metal elements indicate that parts of the provenance included recycled sediments, and that first-cycle sediments were derived mainly from felsic rocks with a minor contribution from intermediate and mafic rocks. The combined detrital zircon U-Pb ages and Hf isotopic results constrain the contributions of different source terranes over time. The provenance results, in combination with seismic profile interpretations from the Sanjiang Basin, suggest that the northeastern Asian continental margin experienced at least three stages of uplift, which were driven by subduction initiation of the Paleo-Pacific Ocean during the Jurassic Period, a plate motion change during the Early Cretaceous Epoch, and a shallowing of the slab dip angle during the Late Cretaceous Epoch.},

   abstract = {The timing of the closure of the Bangong-Nujiang Tethyan Ocean is highly controversial. An important reason for this is that the sedimentological work within the Bangong-Nujiang suture zone is not sufficient. In this study, based on the U-Pb zircon dating of turbiditic sandstone and tuff interlayers, we determine the existence of Aptian flysch (ca. 126-113 Ma) in the middle and western segments of the Bangong-Nujiang suture zone. Further analysis shows that the Aptian flysch was deposited in a trench environment. In space, from the Mabujia Co area in the western segment to the Kama area in the middle segment, the outcrop extent of the Aptian flysch spans nearly 300 km from east to west. These results indicate that the Bangong-Nujiang Tethyan Ocean had not fully closed by the end of Aptian time, and its oceanic slab was still subducting. Based on this new discovery, and the results of previous studies, we believe that the middle and western segments of the Bangong-Nujiang Tethyan Ocean closed between 113 and ca. 92 Ma nonmarine deposition of the Jingzhushan Formation, which lies in angular unconformity above the flysch.},

   abstract = {Upper Triassic to Upper Jurassic strata in the western and northern Sichuan Basin were deposited in a synorogenic foreland basin. Ion-microprobe U-Pb analysis of 364 detrital zircon grains from five Late Triassic to Late Jurassic sandstone samples in the northern Sichuan Basin and several published Middle Triassic to Middle Jurassic samples in the eastern Songpan-Ganzi Complex and western and inner Sichuan Basin provide an initial framework for understanding the Late Triassic to Late Jurassic provenance of western and northern Sichuan Basin. For further understanding, the paleogeographic setting of these areas and neighboring hinterlands was constructed. Combined with analysis of depocenter migration, thermochronology and detrital zircon provenance, the western and northern Sichuan Basin is displayed as a transferred foreland basin from Late Triassic to Late Jurassic. The Upper Triassic Xujiahe depocenter was located at the front of the Longmen Shan belt, and sediments in the western Sichuan Basin shared the same provenances with the Middle-Upper Triassic in the Songpan-Ganzi Complex, whereas the South Qinling fed the northern Sichuan Basin. The synorogenic depocenter transferred to the front of Micang Shan during the early Middle Jurassic and at the front of the Daba Shan during the middle-late Middle Jurassic. Zircons of the Middle Jurassic were sourced from the North Qinling, South Qinling and northern Yangtze Craton. The depocenter returned to the front of the Micang Shan again during the Late Jurassic, and the South Qinling and northern Yangtze Craton was the main provenance. The detrital zircon U-Pb ages imply that the South and North China collision was probably not finished at the Late Jurassic.},

Detrital zircons in this study yield four major age peaks in the early Palaeoproterozoic, early Neoproterozoic, middle Neoproterozoic and late Neoproterozoic - early Palaeozoic. The dominant age population of 900-700 Ma matches well with magmatic ages from the nearby Panxi-Hannan Belt, which indicates that Cambrian-Ordovician sedimentary rocks in the western Yangtze Block were mainly of local derivation. However, compilations of detrital zircon ages for the Cambrian-Ordovician strata from the Cathaysia Block and the eastern Yangtze Block show that both blocks are dominated by late Mesoproterozoic- and early Neoproterozoic-aged detrital zircons, which suggests a remarkable exotic input with typical Gondwana signatures. According to the integrated detrital zircon age spectra of the Cambrian-Ordovician sedimentary rocks from the entire South China Block and palaeocurrent data, the South China Block should have been linked with North India and Western Australia within East Gondwana. Specifically, the Cathaysia Block was located adjacent to Western Australia, while the Yangtze Block was connected with North India.},

   abstract = {Detrital zircon grains were collected from six samples of sedimentary rock from the Middle Jurassic Zhiluo Formation in the western Ordos Basin of China. U-Pb isotopic geochronology data were measured and used to assess the provenance and directions of sediment transport of these grains. Five age populations were recognised amongst the U-Pb age spectra: 2700-2034 Ma, 1999-1426 Ma, 1296-636 Ma, 556-323 Ma, and 315-207 Ma. Each of these groups corresponds to one or several potential sediment sources around the western Ordos Basin. Based on these data and the spatial distribution of the six collected samples, we interpret that the material of the Middle Jurassic Zhiluo Formation in the western Ordos Basin was mainly derived from the northern margin of the North China Craton and the Qilian Orogenic Belt. In addition, the eastern margin of the Alxa Block contributed as a sediment source for certain regions. Detritus was transported via two major supply directions to the western Ordos Basin, and this basin was connected to the Hexi Corridor during the Middle Jurassic. In conclusion, our results are consistent with the closure of Palaeo-ocean and the formation of the orogenic belt.},

   abstract = {The Jiao-Liao-Ji orogenic belt is one of the important Paleoproterozoic mobile belts in the North China Craton (NCC) and its central segment consists of the North and South Liaohe Groups and the Liaoji Granitoids. The North and South Liaohe Groups consist of sedimentary and volcanic successions metamorphosed from greenschist to lower amphibolite facies, and the Liaoji granitoids are divisible into 2.2-2.1 Ga (pre-tectonic) monzogranitic gneisses and 1.88-1.85 Ga (post-tectonic) porphyritic monzogranites and alkaline syenites. Combined with cathodoluminescence (CL) imaging, we report LA-ICP-MS (laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry) U-Pb and Hf isotopic data for detrital zircons from the North and South Liaohe Groups. Zircons grains from both groups have igneous zircon cores that yielded two U-Pb age populations at 2.0-2.2 Ga (major) and similar to 2.5 Ga (minor), indicating that their provenances were similarly dominated by Paleoproterozoic Liaoji Granitoids and late Archean basement rocks. Some structureless zircon rims in both groups yield concordant or upper intercept ages similar to 1.9 Ga, interpreted as the peak metamorphic age of the two groups. These results suggest that both groups were deposited in the period 2.0-1.9 Ga, shortly after the emplacement of the Liaoji Granitoids. Moreover, zircons from both groups have similar Hf model age peaks (T-DM(C) peaks at 2.66-2.75 Ga and 2.80-3.00 Ga) and epsilon Hf values (-5 to +9 and -7 to +5). Based on these striking similarities, we propose that the protoliths of the North and South Groups may have formed simultaneously, and that the basement rocks underneath the two groups belong to the same Archean continental block rather than two different blocks as previously considered. The Archean basement underwent Paleoproterozoic rifting, accompanied by the emplacement of the Liaoji granitoids at 2.2-2.1 Ga and the deposition of the North and South Liaohe Groups at 2.1-1.9 Ga, and the rift was subsequently closed by similar to 1.9 Ga.

   abstract = {As a major lithostratigraphic unit of the Palaeoproterozoic Jiao-Liao-Ji Belt in the Eastern Block of the North China Craton, the Liaohe Group consists of an assemblage that is transitional from a lower arkose- and volcanic-rich sequence (Langzishan, Li'eryu and Gaojiayu Formations), through a middle carbonate-rich sequence (Dashiqiao Formation) to an upper argillaceous sequence (Gaixian Formation). Tectonically associated with the Liaohe Group are large volumes of granitoid rocks, named the Liaoji Granite, whose emplacement age has been dated at about 2.1-2.2 Ga. Regionally, the Liaohe Group and the associated Liaoji Granite extend along a NEE-trending belt that is flanked by 2.45-2.55 Ga basement gneisses. U-Pb zircon data and cathodoluminescence (CL) imaging are used to constrain the maximum depositional and metamorphic ages of the Liaohe Group, which are critical in understanding the tectonic setting and history of the Jiao-Liao-Ji Belt. Cathodoluminescence images reveal that most detrital zircon grains from the Liaohe Group are characterized by concentric oscillatory zoning, with comparatively low luminescence and high Th/U ratios, suggesting magmatic origin, but minor zircon grains have structureless overgrowth or recrystallization rims that are characterized by low Th/U ratio, indicating metamorphic origin. Results of this study, show that the detrital zircon grains of the Langzishan Formation, the lowest sequence of the Liaohe Group, have concordant U-Pb ages ranging from 2.05 to 2.24 Ga, suggesting that the Liaohe Group was deposited at some time after 2.05 Ga. Although most overgrowth or recrystallization rims are too narrow to be analyzed, some rims yield concordant or upper intercept ages around 1.93 Ga, interpreted as the peak metamorphic age of the Liaohe Group. Detrital zircon grains from the Dashiqiao Formation in the middle sequence of the Liaohe Group have concordant U-Pb ages ranging from 2.25 to 2.53 Ga, some of which are similar to those of the basement gneisses in the area. This study indicates that the Liaohe Group was deposited after the emplacement of the Liaoji Granite, and the latter may be a major component of the provenance for the Langzishan Formation. In contrast, the protoliths of the middle sequence of the Liaohe Group were most probably derived from the basement gneisses. These new zircon ages for the Liaohe Group and recent data for the Liaoji Granite, combined with lithological, structural and metamorphic considerations, support a rifting model for the evolution of the Jiao-Liao-Ji Belt.

   abstract = {The provenance of Upper Oligocene to Upper Miocene sandstones in the western Qiongdongnan Basin was studied by zircon U-Pb ages. More than 200 zircon grains were separated from the sandstone of the Upper Oligocene Lingshui, Lower Miocene Sanya, and Upper Miocene Huangliu formations, and spot analysed for U-Pb dating. Most zircon grains from the Upper Oligocene Lingshui and Upper Miocene Huangliu formations had rounded corners, suggesting that the grains were transported a relatively long distance before deposition, while grains from the Lower Miocene Sanya Formation were usually angular in shape, implying a shorter transport distance from their provenance. The Lingshui Formation contained exclusively Cenozoic, Mesozoic, Palaeozoic, and Proterozoic zircon ages, and the age spectrum showed two major peaks at ca. 247 and 441 Ma, along with nine subordinate age peaks at ca. 35, 305, 517, 623, 811, 852, 911, 1158, and 1905 Ma. This indicates that Upper Oligocene sediments in the northwestern area of the Qiongdongnan Basin may have originated from the Red River system, which had four major peaks at 254, 418, 751, and 1848 Ma, and five subordinate peaks at ca. 32, 81, 514, 606, and 967 Ma. Results suggest that sediments from the Red River system entered the Qiongdongnan Basin as early as the Late Oligocene. The zircon age spectrum of the Sanya Formation had two major peaks at 99 and 237 Ma, indicating that Lower Miocene sandstones in the northwestern area of the Qiongdongnan Basin were mainly from Hainan Island, with ages ranging from 110 to 90 to 280-220 Ma. This study infers that the sandstones may be the paleo-Red River capture by the Yangze River, which resulted in a large decrease of sediment supply from the paleo-Red River system, such that the sediments of the paleo-Red River did not develop in the western area of the Qiongdongnan Basin during the Early Miocene. Results indicate that if the Red River capture existed, it would have predated the Early Miocene. The zircon age spectrum from Upper Miocene sediments of the western Qiongdongnan Basin showed five major age peaks at ca. 27, 88, 256, 415, and 785 Ma, indicating that its provenance was the Red River system. The Late Miocene provenance change from Hainan Island to the Red River may have been in response to a major phase of the Tibetan Plateau uplift.},

   abstract = {The tectonic nature of Early Palaeozoic Kwangsian orogeny in the South China Block (SCB) is still debated, due to controversy whether there was a Cambrian ocean between the Yangtze Block and the Cathaysia Block. Similarly, continental affinities of the SCB with India and Australia in East Gondwana during the Cambrian are also controversial. Herein, we present detrital zircon U-Pb geochronology of Cambrian sandstone samples from the southern SCB. Cambrian samples (including our new samples and published samples) from the Cathaysia Block and the Yangtze Block show similar detrital zircon age spectra with one prominent age cluster of similar to 1000-900 Ma and several subordinate age groups, as well as similar cumulative proportion curves (CPC). Such signatures, together with other geological records, suggest that a Cambrian ocean did not exist between the Cathaysia Block and the Yangtze Block, and that Early Palaeozoic Kwangsian orogeny resulted from an intra-continental collision. Cambrian samples from the SCB have much more similar detrital zircon age spectra and CPC to those from Himalaya and Qiangtang than those from Australia, but detrital zircons in Cambrian samples from the SCB, Himalaya, Qiangtang and Australia have a similar prominent age group of similar to 1000-900 Ma. Thus, the SCB were likely located between Australia and India during the Cambrian, receiving sediments both from India and Australia.},

   abstract = {Located between the Bangong-Nujiang suture zone and the Qiangtang Block in central Tibet, the Najiangco area (similar to 5 km to the north of Nima-Selinco) contains an Upper Jurassic-Lower Cretaceous sedimentary succession deposited during a period of marine regression. The youngest marine sedimentary unit in the Najiangco area is the Upper Jurassic Shamuluo Formation, which consists of sandstone, limestone, siltstone, and shale. Sedimentary facies analysis shows that tidal flat and subtidal lagoonal facies characterized the northern margin of the basin, while delta front and prodelta facies dominated the middle part, and carbonate shoal and patch reef facies prevailed along the southern margin. Provenance analysis, including petrographic modal analysis of sandstones and U-Pb dating of detrital zircons, shows that a recycled orogen in the central Qiangtang to the north of Najiangco area was the source of the sandstones in the Shamuluo Formation. Biostratigraphy and U-Pb zircon dating of a porphyritic granitoid dike (151 +/- 2 Ma) indicate that the Shamuluo Formation was deposited during the Late Jurassic (Oxfordian to Kimmeridgian). During Middle Jurassic time, the southern Qiangtang Basin was dominated by shallow-marine environments. Later, during the Late Jurassic (Oxfordian to Kimmeridgian), the shallow-marine facies retreated to the southern margin of the basin. Combined with regional paleogeographic data from central Tibet, two stages of southward retreat of the Qiangtang remnant sea, and three stages of topographic uplift of the Qiangtang Block can be recognized during late Middle Jurassic to Early Cretaceous time.},

   abstract = {The Mesozoic stratigraphic record of the southern Qiangtang basin in central Tibet records the evolution and closure of the Bangong-Nujiang ocean to the south. The Jurassic succession includes Toarcian-Aalenian shallow-marine limestones (Quse Formation), Aalenian-Bajocian feldspatho-litho-quartzose to feldspatho-quartzo-lithic sandstones (shallow-marine Sewa Formation and deep-sea Gaaco Formation), and Bathonian outer platform to shoal limestones (Buqu Formation). This succession is truncated by an angular unconformity, overlain by upper Bathonian to lower Callovian fan-delta conglomerates and litho-quartzose to quartzo-lithic sandstones (Biluoco Formation) and Callovian shoal to outer platform limestones (Suowa Formation). Sandstone petrography coupled with detrital-zircon U-Pb and Hf isotope analysis indicate that the Sewa and Gaaco formations contain intermediate to felsic volcanic detritus and youngest detrital zircons (183-170 Ma) with epsilon(Hf)(t) ranging widely from + 13 to - 25, pointing to continental-arc provenance from igneous rocks with mixed mantle and continental-crust contributions. An arc-trench system thus developed toward the end of the Early Jurassic, with the southern Qiangtang basin representing the fore-arc basin. Above the angular unconformity, the Biluoco Formation documents a change to dominant sedimentary detritus including old detrital zircons (mainly > 500 Ma ages in the lower part of the unit) with age spectra similar to those from Paleozoic strata in the central Qiangtang area. A major tectonic event with intense folding and thrusting thus took place in late Bathonian time (166 +/- 1 Ma), when the Qiangtang block collided with another microcontinental block possibly the Lhasa block.},

   abstract = {The timing of Bangong-Nujiang suture ophiolite obduction between the Lhasa and Qiangtang terranes in central Tibet is important for understanding the closure history of the Meso-Tethys but remains poorly constrained. We investigated subaerial to shallow marine strata of the Dongqiao Formation that sit unconformably on Bangong-Nujiang suture ophiolites that crystallized in a supra-subduction zone setting at 189-181 Ma. Based on foraminiferal and coral studies, the depositional age of the Dongqiao Formation is constrained to be Oxfordian and Kimmeridgian (Late Jurassic). Provenance analyses including detrital modes, geochemistry of detrital chromian spinels, and U-Pb age populations of detrital zircons suggest the Dongqiao Formation was sourced from uplifted Bangong-Nujiang suture ophiolites and sedimentary and metamorphic rocks of Lhasa terrane affinity to the south. We conclude that Bangong-Nujiang suture ophiolites were obducted soon after crystallization (prior to Oxfordian time; >163 Ma) onto the Lhasa terrane or a microcontinent of Lhasa terrane affinity.
Plain Language Summary Ophiolite obduction often occurs when a passive continental margin enters an oceanic subduction zone and thus may mark when an arc-continent or continent-continent collision begins. In central Tibet, the Dongqiao ophiolite represents a relict of Meso-Tethys oceanic lithosphere. Initial research during the 1980s provided rough constraints on the timing, polarity, and mechanism of Dongqiao ophiolite obduction. However, there has been little advancement in our knowledge of the obduction history since. Here we report results of sedimentologic, stratigraphic, and provenance studies on the Dongqiao Formation overlying the Dongqiao ophiolite. Our foraminiferal and coral biostratigraphic data show that subaerial to shallow marine strata of the Dongqiao Formation were deposited between 163 and 152 million years ago. We demonstrate that the clastic rocks in the Dongqiao Formation received detritus from both the underlying Dongqiao ophiolite and Lhasa terrane affinity continental crust. We propose that a continental margin of Lhasa terrane affinity entered a north-dipping oceanic trench, and the Dongqiao ophiolite was obducted southwards on to it, no later than 163 million years ago.},

   abstract = {The NE-NNE-trending Yuan-Ma Basin in central South China, an overprinted basin, is important for understanding the transition in Mesozoic intracontinental deformation in South China from compressional to extensional settings. A detailed sedimentary and structural cross-section across the basin reveals the Upper Triassic - Lower Jurassic black coal-bearing shale, greyish-green sandstone and brick-red claystone, and the Middle Jurassic brick-red sandstone, pebbly sandstone and conglomerate in the eastern segment of the basin. The Lower Cretaceous brick-red coarse sandstone, pebbly sandstone and siltstone occurred in the western and central segments, as well as fault breccia and Lower Cretaceous sandstone at the western margin of the basin. Detrital zircon U-Pb dating by laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry shows that the magmatic and metamorphic zircons yield significant age clusters at 900-700, 500-350 and 300-150 Ma, as well a minor age cluster at 120-100 Ma. Synthesizing the stratigraphic sequences, structures, isotopic dating results and palaeocurrent data, we infer that the Yuan-Ma Basin experienced three evolutionary stages and tectonic settings: (1) during Late Triassic - Early Jurassic time, the Yuan-Ma Basin was related to the diachronous progressive intracontinental deformation as a result of the early Mesozoic Xuefeng intracontinental orogeny in South China; (2) during Middle-Late Jurassic time, the Yuan-Ma Basin was related to intracontinental compression in South China; and (3) during late Early Cretaceous time, the Yuan-Ma Basin was constrained by the intracontinental extension that occurred in eastern China. These three stages, a result of various tectonic regimes, caused the intracontinental deformation that was controlled by the evolution of the continents and their margins.},

   abstract = {The closure of Mianlue Ocean lead to the collisional assembly between the North China Block (NCB) and the South China Block (SCB). But the timing of initial continental collision remains unclear, with the proposed ages ranging from the Late Permian to the Late Triassic. This study presents stratigraphic, sedimentological, tectonic subsidence, and provenance data from the Triassic strata in the Zigui and Dangyang basins lying along the eastern Qinling Orogenic Belt. These data document a tectonic transition in the central northern-SCB, and locally provide constraints on the timing of initial SCB-NCB collision. The Lower Triassic Daye Formation was deposited in a marginal basin to slope environment, and consists of mudrocks containing detrital zircons with major age peaks at ca. 1900 and 850 Ma. The overlying Lower Triassic Jialingjiang Formation comprises a shallowing carbonate sequence, with intercalated evaporites at the top of the formation. It contains mudrocks that are rich in detrital zircons with of ca. 270-245 Ma. The mixed carbonate and siliciclastic sequences of the Middle-Upper Triassic Badong Formation records tectonic uplift at its base, and contains detrital zircons with U-Pb age peaks at ca. 2500, 1850, 920-800, 450 and 350-220 Ma. Combined with petrographical observations and tectonic subsidence calculation, these detrital zircon U-Pb ages record a significant provenance change from recycled material derived from the SCB to newly generated detrital material from the NCB. This provenance change records the initial SCB-NCB collision in the eastern Qinling Orogenic Belt during the Early Triassic.},

   abstract = {As one of the most important Early Paleozoic arc systems in the Central Asian Orogenic Belt, the tectonic affinity of the Bainaimiao arc belt is highly controversial. This study performed paleocurrent, petrography, trace elements of the whole rocks and U-Pb geochronology of tuff and detrital zircons of the Early Devonian deposits, to constrain the tectonic affinity of the Bainaimiao arc belt. New zircon U-Pb age constrains the Xibiehe Formation to the Early Devonian. Both the Xibiehe and Qiankuntougou formations show similar framework mineral and trace element components, suggesting a dissected ensialic island arc source. However, the U-Pb age spectra of detrital zircons for the two formations are totally different. The Xibiehe Formation reflects continuous ages ranging 1977-597 Ma, indicating the Bainaimiao arc origin. The Qiankuntougou Formation has a mixed source displaying the North China Craton-derived ages (similar to 1.85 and similar to 2.52 Ga) and Bainaimiao arc ages (similar to 1.4, similar to 1.2, similar to 0.97, 0.55, and 0.5-0.43 Ga). The comparable age components indicate that the Bainaimiao arc is an exotic terrane accreted to the North China Craton in an arc-continent collision way at ca. 430-410 Ma. The arc-continent collision and the following postorogenic magmatism (410-360 Ma), sedimentation during extensional collapse and south dipping subduction complex evolution imply a subduction polarity flip from the northward subduction to the southward subduction.},

   abstract = {The Inner Mongolia Highland (IMH), along the northern edge of the North China Craton, was considered to be a long-standing topographic highland, whose exhumation history remains elusive. The aim of this study is to reveal Late Paleozoic exhumation processes of the IMH based on an integrated analysis of stratigraphy, petrography of clastic rocks, and U-Pb ages and Hf isotopes of detrital zircons from Permian-Triassic succession in the middle Yanshan belt. The results of the study show that the Benxi Formation, which was originally regarded as a Late Carboniferous unit, proves to be Early Permian in age because it contains detrital zircons as young as similar to 298 Ma. The Lower Shihezi Formation is demonstrated to be a unit whose age spans the boundary of the Middle and Upper Permian, constrained by a U-Pb age of 260 2 Ma from a dacite layer. Clastic compositions of conglomerate and sandstone change markedly, characterised by the predominance of sedimentary components in the Benxi-Shanxi Formations, by large amounts of volcanic clastics in the Lower and Upper Shihezi Formations, and by the presence of both metamorphic and igneous clastics in the Sunjiagou-Ermaying Formations. Sedimentary clastics include chert, carbonate, sandstone and quartzite, which may have been derived from Proterozoic to Lower Paleozoic sedimentary covers. Volcanic clasts were directly related to volcanic eruptions, while granite and gneiss grains were sourced from exhumed Late Paleozoic intrusive rocks and basement rocks. Detrital zircon U-Pb ages can be divided into five populations: 2.6-2.4 Ga, 1.9-1.7 Ga, 400-360 Ma, 325-290 Ma and 270-250 Ma. Precambrian detrital zircons are typically subrounded to rounded in shape, implying a recycling origin. Late Paleozoic zircons show oscillatory zones and their Th/U ratios >0.4, suggesting a magmatic origin. Most Phanerozoic zircons have negative epsilon(Hf)(T) values of -3.2 to -25.5, which are compatible with those of Late Paleozoic plutons in the IMH. The results indicate that the IMH may have been covered with Proterozoic to Lower Paleozoic sedimentary strata, which then underwent subsequent erosion and served as provenances for adjacent Late Paleozoic basins. Vertical changes in both clastic compositions and detrital zircon ages in Permian-Triassic strata imply an unroofing process of the IMH. Three phases of the IMH uplift are distinguished. The first-phase uplift commenced 325-312 Ma and resulted from magmatic intrusion related to southward subduction of the Paleo-Asian Ocean. The second-phase uplift took place in the Middle Permian and may be attributed to crustal contraction related to the collision of the North China Craton and the Southern Mongolia terrane. The third-phase uplift happened at the end of the Permian, and may have been induced by upwelling of calc-alkali magma under an extensional setting. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {The Tarim Block is an important geologic unit in the reconstruction of the tectonic evolution of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt and the Precambrian Columbia and Rodinia supercontinents. In order to examine the evolution and crustal generation of the Tarim Block, we performed detrital zircon U-Pb dating and in situ Hf isotopic analysis of Devonian sandstones of the Baluntai area in Central Tianshan, which is part of the Tarim Block. Most analyzed zircon grains show oscillatory zoning and have Th/U ratios >0.4, suggesting that they were mainly derived from igneous rocks. A total of about 400 detrital zircon analyses yielded five age populations, namely, early Paleoproterozoic (peak at 2470 Ma), middle Paleoproterozoic (peak at 1858 Ma), early Mesoproterozoic (peak at 1541 Ma), early Neoproterozoic (peak at 952 Ma), and late Neoproterozoic (820-750 Ma). These peak ages are remarkably consistent with the polyphase tectonothermal events that occurred in the Tarim Block. The peak at 2470 Ma indicates the presence of late Neoarchean to early Paleoproterozoic magmatism in the Tarim Block. The two peaks at 1858 Ma and 952 Ma coincide with the two periods of assembly of the Columbia and Rodinia supercontinents. This further suggests that the Tarim Block was part of these two supercontinents. In fact, the age peak of 1541 Ma correlates with the breakup of Columbia, and the age range of 820-750 Ma is interpreted to represent the time of the breakup of Rodinia. The zircon Hf model ages suggest three major stages of crustal evolution at 1.0-1.4 Ga, 1.8-3.3 Ga, and 3.4-3.8 Ga. The zircons exhibit a huge range of epsilon(Hf)(t) values from -33 to +51, suggesting that they were derived from highly diverse protoliths. However, since most detrital zircons show negative epsilon(Hf)(t) values, the protoliths of the Baluntai sandstones of Central Tianshan probably comprise rocks of Archean to Proterozoic crust. Owing to the similar Precambrian basement, lithology and age spectra between Central Tianshan and Tarim, it is argued that Central Tianshan belonged to the Tarim Block in the Precambrian time. Furthermore, euhedral zircons with high Th/U ratios (>0.4) yielded a prominent peak of 447 Ma. This can be correlated with an early Paleozoic arc development in Central Tianshan.

   abstract = {The Central Tianshan, which is proposed to be part of the Tarim Block during Precambrian time, holds a pivotal role in the evolution of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt. In this study we employ detrital zircon age spectra to probe the Precambrian history of the region and to evaluate the link with the Proterozoic supercontinents. Detailed U-Pb zircon age data are reported for detrital zircons from Neoproterozoic metasedimentary rocks in the Baluntai region, the heartland of Central Tianshan. The metasediments here are dominated by zircons with major age populations of 2544-2394 Ma, 1900-1500 Ma, 1070-752 Ma, ca. 560 Ma and ca. 445 Ma. The 2544-2394 Ma ages correlate with the generation of continental nuclei in Tarim. The tectonothermal events during the periods of 1900-1500 Ma and 1070-752 Ma correspond to the assembly and breakup of the Columbia and Rodinia supercontinents. The magmatic ages represented by the age peak at ca. 560 Ma correlate with those reported from the Late Neoproterozoic-Cambrian orogens in different fragments of the Gondwana supercontinent. The youngest age peak of ca. 445 Ma is interpreted to represent the Caledonian orogenic event in Central Tianshan that is linked to the history of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt. Recyling of ancient crustal materials dominated, with minor input of juvenile materials during the above time intervals, with exception at ca. 2460 Ma when significant addition of juvenile material occurred. A combination of U-Pb dating and Hf-isotope data in our study reveals that Central Tianshan was a part of the Tarim Block. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {The Central Tianshan region is a key to evaluate the Paleoproterozoic evolution of the Tarim Block and its correlation with the Columbia supercontinent. In this study, we present U-Pb age data on detrital zircons in Paleoproterozoic schists from Central Tianshan and employ the magmatic age spectra to probe the Precambrian history of the region. We use the U-Pb ages of metamorphic zircons to constrain the Paleoproterozoic collisional event of the Tarim Block, and to evaluate its link with the Columbia supercontinent. The age populations of the detrital igneous zircons and inherited cores show peaks at similar to 2544 Ma, similar to 2397 Ma, similar to 2264 Ma, similar to 2161 Ma, similar to 1970 Ma and similar to 1882 Ma, corresponding to the major tectonomagmatic events previously recorded in the Tarim Block. Combined with the results from previous studies, we conclude that the northern Tarim was an active continental margin from late Neoarchean to late Paleoproterozoic. Zircons in the Paleoproterozoic schists display a wide range of two-stage model ages (3.3-2.7 Ga), revealing prolonged growth of juvenile crust in Tarim from late Paleoarchean to early Neoarchean. The tightly constrained age range of 1830-1788 Ma (weighted mean 1808 Ma) obtained from the metamorphic zircons and overgrowth mantles mark the timing of the thermal event associated with the final collisional orogeny along the northern margin of Tarim, coinciding with the assembly of the Columbia supercontinent.

   abstract = {The Jiangnan Orogeny generated regional angular unconformities between the Xiajiang Group and the underlying Sibao Group in the western Jiangnan Orogen along the southeastern margin of the Yangtze Block in southeast Guizhou, South China. Laser ablation - inductively coupled plasma - mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) U-Pb zircon dating of two samples of the Motianling granitic pluton yielded U-Pb zircon ages of 826.2 +/- 3.4 and 825.5 +/- 6.1 Ma, with an average age of 825.6 +/- 3.0 Ma, which is considered the minimum depositional age of the Sibao Group. The U-Pb ages of the youngest detrital zircon grains from the Sibao Group and the Xiajiang Group yielded average ages of 834.9 +/- 3.8 and 794.6 +/- 4.2 Ma, respectively. The depositional age of the Sibao Group can be constrained at 825-835 Ma, and deposition of the Xiajiang Group did not begin before ca. 800 Ma. These results suggest that the Jiangnan Orogeny, which led to the assembly of the Yangtze and Cathaysia blocks, ended at 795-835 Ma on the western segment of the Jiangnan Orogen. The detrital zircon distribution spectrums of the Sibao and Xiajiang groups suggest a provenance from Neoproterozoic basement sedimentary sequences along with a mixture of local Neoproterozoic subduction-related felsic granitoids, distant plutons from the western Yangtze Block and eastern Jiangnan Orogen, and recycled materials from the interior of the Yangtze Block. By comparing the basin evolution histories and magmatic and metamorphic events along the continental margins of the Rodinia supercontinent, it is proposed that the South China Block might have been located at the periphery, adjacent to North India and East Antarctica, rather than in the interior of Rodinia in Neoproterozoic time.},

The Early Cretaceous sedimentary sequence is useful to trace the tectonic evolution of the Southern Qinling Microcontinent and sedimentary provenances. Detrital zircon grains from the Early Cretaceous sediments in Southern Qinling Microcontinent yield five U-Pb age clusters of 2600 similar to 2300Ma, 2050 similar to 1800Ma, 1200 similar to 750Ma, 650 similar to 400Ma and 350 similar to 200Ma, corresponding five supercontinental events, namely Kenor, Columbia, Rodinia, Gondwana and Pangaea, respectively. The zircon grains have very complicated sources, but mainly from the Northern Qinling Accretionary Belt and North China Craton, implying that the Southern Qinling Microcontinent was a part of the Qinling-North China united continent, never being an isolated continent, during Late Paleozoic. The youngest age peak constrained that the subduction duration of the Mian-Lue ocean plate northwardly beneath the Qinling-North China united continent was 350 similar to 200Ma; and that the continental collision between the Yangtze Craton and the Qinling-North China united continent began at the Triassic-Jurassic transition, and culminated in Jurassic, instead of in Triassic or earlier suggested in previous studies.},

   abstract = {We conduct sandstone-composition analysis, U-Pb detrital-zircon dating, and apatite fission-track thermochronology to determine how basin development was associated with the Cenozoic deformation across central Tibet. Our results are consistent with a two-stage basin development model: first a single fluvial-lacustrine system formed (i.e., Paleo-Qaidam basin) in between two thrust belts (i.e., the Fenghuoshan and Qilian Shan thrust belts) in the Paleogene, which was later partitioned into two sub-basins in the Neogene by the Kunlun transpressional system and its associated uplift. The southern sub-basin (i.e., Hoh Xil basin) strata have detritalzircon age populations at 210-300 Ma and 390-480 Ma for the Eocene strata and at 220-310 Ma and 400-500 Ma for the early Miocene strata; petrologic analysis indicates that the late Cretaceous-Eocene strata were recycled from the underlying Jurassic rocks. The northern sub-basin (i.e., Qaidam basin) strata yield detrital-zircon age clusters at 210-290 Ma and 370-480 Ma in the Eocene, 220-280 Ma and 350-500 Ma in the Oligocene, 250-290 Ma and 395-510 Ma in the Miocene, and 225-290 Ma and 375-480 Ma in the Pliocene. Proterozoic ages of the detrital zircon are most useful for determining provenance: the pre-Neogene Hoh Xil and Qaidam strata all contain the distinctive age peaks of similar to 1800 Ma and similar to 2500 Ma from the Songpan-Ganzi terrane south of the Kunlun fault, whereas detrital zircon of this age is absent in the Neogene Qaidam strata suggesting the emergence of a topographic barrier between the two basins. This inference is consistent with our fission-track thermochronological data from the Eastern Kunlun Range that suggest rapid cooling within the range did not start until after 30-20 Ma. Our new data support the Paleo-Qaidam hypothesis that requires the Hoh Xil and Qaidam basins were parts of a single Paleogene basin bounded by the Qilian Shan and Fenghuoshan thrust belts.},

   abstract = {The Changhai metamorphic supracrustal rocks, located in the eastern-central part of the Jiao-Li-Ji Belt in the North China Craton (NCC), are composed mainly of various garnet-mica schists, along with minor quartzites and marbles. This study presents whole-rock major and trace element data, zircon U-Pb dates and Hf isotope data for these rocks in order to constrain their protolith age and provenance, and discuss the tectonic implications. Geochemical results indicate that the source rocks were mainly granitoids with a possible minor contribution from clastic sediments with an active continental margin signature. Detrital zircons have U-Pb age peaks at approximately 1887, 2174, 2552, 2765, and 3212 Ma, epsilon(Hf) values of -11.1 to +13.0, and three major time windows of average continent crustal model ages (T-DM(C)) of 2.04-2.33, 2.48-2.56, and 2.72-2.93 Ga. Besides, these units also contain significant numbers of concordant metamorphic zircons that yielded a peak age of ca. 248 Ma, indicating that the region was modified by an early Triassic tectono-thermal event. These results suggest that sediments of the Changhai metamorphic supracrustal rocks were mainly sourced from nearby basement granitoid rocks and, to a lesser extent, from Paleoproterozoic metamorphosed strata such as the North and South Liaohe groups. Furthermore, the source rocks of the magmatic zircons analyzed in this study appear to have originated from interaction between old continental crust and juvenile material. The youngest concordant zircon age peak at 1879 Ma coincides with the timing of formation of regionally widespread granitoids, mafic igneous rocks, and metamorphism of the South Liaohe and Ji'an groups in the Jiao-Liao-Ji Belt, and suggest that the sedimentary protoliths of the Changhai metamorphic supracrustal rocks were deposited after this time. The results indicate that the Archean Liaobei-Jinan Complex in the north and the Liaonan-Nangrim Complex in the south were already a single continental block by 1887 Ma, and that the Changhai metamorphic supracrustal rocks were deposited at an active continental margin.

   abstract = {In situ U-Pb geochronological, Hf isotopic and REE geochemical analyses of detrital zircons from Mesozoic sandstones in central Jiangxi and east Hunan of the South China Block (SCB) are used to provide not only information about crustal evolution process, but more importantly new constraints on sedimentary provenances as well as Mesozoic basin evolutions in central SCB. A total of 417 concordant zircon analyses define five U-Pb age populations at ca. 2.6-2.3 Ga, ca. 2.0-1.7 Ga, ca. 1.0-0.7 Ga, ca. 500400 Ma and ca. 300-200 Ma. Integrated analyses of zircon U-Pb ages and Hf isotopes of detrital zircons reveal five episodes of juvenile continental crust growth: ca. 2.5 Ga, ca. 1.7 Ga, ca. 850 Ma, ca. 440 Ma and ca. 230 Ma, with all but the ca. 2.5 Ga episode likely represent that of the SCB. None of the three samples from T-3-J(1) strata showed strong ca. 1850 Ma and ca. 230 Ma peaks suggesting that the T-3-J(1) sediments probably sourced from the Yangtze Block. In contrast, stronger peaks of ca. 1850 Ma and ca. 250-230 Ma in post-J(1) strata relative to that of T-3-J(1) strata suggest a dominantly local Cathaysian provenance. In addition, the distinct low epsilon Hf(T) values for zircons of ca. 430 Ma from T-3-J(1) strata in comparison with higher epsilon Hf(T) values for that from post-J(1) strata also support aforementioned viewpoint. Such sharp changes between the pre-J(1) and post-J(1) strata coincide with the remarkable change in regional palaeogeography from a broad shallow marine basin in the Late Triassic-Early Jurassic time to a basin-and-range-style province in the Middle Jurassic. The characteristics and time evolution of detrital zircons from the studied area are consistent with the flat-slab subduction model which involves the development of a broad sag basin during the T-3-J(1) time, and a rapid regional uplift in the Cathaysia Block caused by the reinitiating of normal subduction along the coastal region at ca. 190 Ma.

   abstract = {This paper aims to reconstruct early Mesozoic tectonic settings of the northern North China craton based on investigations of Triassic-Middle Jurassic successions and age determinations of some lithostratigraphic units and dikes cutting tilted early Mesozoic strata. It used to be regarded that the northern North China craton experienced fold-thrust deformations in the Triassic to Early Jurassic based on the occurrences of unconformity beneath Triassic/Lower Jurassic units, synorogenic conglomerate, and Late Triassic thrusting. We revisited early Mesozoic stratigraphy of the Xiabancheng basin in the middle Yanshan belt to restore tectonic environments during that period of time. Detrital zircon data reveal that the Liujiagou and Ermaying Formations are actually of Middle and Late Triassic ages, respectively. Field observations show that the Ermaying and Xingshikou Formations are conformable, making up a sequence from fluvial to alluvial-fan facies. It is also noticeable that Lower-Middle Jurassic Xingshikou through Xiahuayuan succession is typified by fining- and deepening-upward depositional trend and contains abundant volcaniclastic rocks, indicative of continued subsidence of the Xiabancheng basin in a volcanic setting. All the results cast doubts on the long-held view that the first phase of shortening in the northern North China craton happened in the Late Triassic or Early Jurassic. The angular unconformity beneath Upper Jurassic Tiaojishan volcanics registered shortening in the northern North China craton, which plausibly took place around 170 Ma on account of zircon U-Pb ages of two dikes penetrating deformed Middle Triassic-Lower Jurassic strata and ages of Tiaojishan volcanics above the unconformity. Given the widespread occurrence of magmatism, rift basins and metamorphic core complexes during the Triassic and Early Jurassic, it follows that the northern North China craton was more likely under an extensional setting during the early Mesozoic.

The ages of 85 detrital zircon grains are divided into three groups: 252-290 Ma, 1740-2000 Ma, and 2400-2600 Ma. The lack of Early Paleozoic and Neoproterozoic U-Pb ages indicates that there is no input from the Qinling Orogen, because the Qinling Orogen is characterized by Paleozoic and Neoproterozoic material. In combination with previous research, we suggest that the source of the Chunshuyao Formation is most likely recycled from previous sedimentary rocks from the North China Craton. In the Late Triassic, the Funiu ancient land was uplifted which prevented source material from the Qinling Orogen. Owing to the Indosinian orogeny, the strata to the east of the North China Craton were uplifted and eroded. The Yichuan Basin received detrital material from the North China Craton.},

   abstract = {Xiong'er volcanism and the accompanying sedimentation that occurred along the southern margin of the North China Craton (NCC) are thought to be related to the breakup or outgrowth of the Columbia supercontinent. A series of conglomerates, pebbly sandstones, coarse- to fine-grained sandstones, siltstones, and argillaceous rocks that comprise the Bingmagou Formation unconformably overlie the Paleoproterozoic Xiong'er volcanic rocks, which themselves are unconformably overlain by Mesoproterozoic sediments (Wufoshan and Ruyang Groups) within the southern margin of the NCC. The Bingmagou Formation is considered to be one of the oldest known clastic deposits, providing information on tectonic evolution subsequent to the Xiong'er volcanism. These rocks comprise a fan delta facies sequence and can be divided into fan delta plain, fan delta front, and pro-fan delta subfacies. Detrital zircons from the formation reveal the presence of two major age peaks at ca. 2700 Ma and 2500 Ma, and one minor age peak at ca. 2100 Ma; indicative of an NCC basement provenance. Samples from the Ma'anshan Formation (Wufoshan Group) yield a major age peak at ca. 1850 Ma, a minor peak at ca. 2500 Ma, and include several younger ages between ca. 1698 Ma and 1798 Ma. These ages are indicative of progressive evolution of provenance between the Bingmagou Formation and the overlying Ma'anshan Formation. The geochemistry of Bingmagou Formation sediments is indicative of felsic source rocks with arc-like affinities, which is markedly distinct from the upper groups. Sedimentary facies, regional unconformities, and detrital zircon data may indicate an uplift in the source area.},

   abstract = {Sedimentary rocks in the Gangdese magmatic arc document a long but poorly constrained series of tectonic events that led to basin formation. We investigate one of these events by using detrital zircon grains from Mesozoic sedimentary rocks from the Linbuzong Formation located within the Gangdese magmatic arc. Our aims are to determine the provenance of the rocks in this back-arc basin and to document the paleo-topographical uplift of the Gangdese region in southern Tibet. Detrital zircons from the Linbuzong Formation, located in the middle-eastern segment of the southern Lhasa sub-terrane, have ages in four dominant populations: 140-300 Ma, 480-700 Ma, 1000-1250 Ma, and 1400-1700 Ma. The youngest detrital zircon cluster has a weighted age of ca. 149 Ma which, in conjunction with previously published data, indicates that sedimentary rocks in the Linbuzong Formation were deposited after 149 Ma. The youngest detrital zircon grains have low Hf-176/Hf-177 isotopic ratios and negative (epsilon Hf)(t) values, similar to igneous zircons from the central Lhasa sub-terrane which is considered to be the predominant source for sediments. However, few zircon grains from the youngest age cluster have high Hf-176/Hf-177 ratios with significantly positive (epsilon Hf)(t) values, suggesting derivation of some sediments from the southern Lhasa sub-terrane, primarily the Gangdese magmatic arc. Combined with the evidence for two conspicuous age populations (480-700 Ma and 1000-1250 Ma) and the Hf isotopic characteristics of the Linbuzong Formation, we propose that the Carboniferous-Permian metasedimentary rocks from the central Lhasa subterrane serve as the main source of sediments for the Linbuzong Formation. We conclude that the central Lhasa sub-terrane was exhumed to the surface and attained a high relief, whereas the Gangdese magmatic arc had a relatively low relief (near sea-level) during the Late Jurassic to the Early Cretaceous.},

   abstract = {With the aim of better understanding the history of ocean closure and suturing between India and Asia, we conducted a geologic investigation of a siliciclastic matrix tectonic melange within the western Yarlung suture zone of southern Tibet (Lopu Range region, similar to 50 km northwest of Saga). The siliciclastic matrix melange includes abundant blocks of ocean plate stratigraphy and sparse blocks of sandstone. Metapelite and metabasite blocks in the melange exhibit lower greenschist fades mineral assemblages, indicating that they were not deeply subducted. We obtained detrital zircon U-Pb geochronologic and sandstone petrographic data from sandstone blocks in the melange and sandstone beds from Tethyan Himalayan strata exposed to the south of the suture. The sandstones from both units are all similar in U-Pb detrital zircon age spectra and petrography to the nearby Tethyan Cretaceous-Paleocene Sangdanlin section, which records the earliest appearance (at similar to 59 Ma) of arc-affinity strata deposited conformably on Indian-affinity strata. Two Paleocene sandstones, one of which is a schistose block incorporated in the siliciclastic matrix melange, yielded indistinguishable maximum depositional ages of similar to 59 Ma. Mesozoic Asian-affinity sandstone blocks previously documented in the siliciclastic matrix melange 200-500 km along strike to the east are notably absent in the Lopu Range region. We documented a gradational transition in structural style from the block-in-matrix melange in the northeast to the south-vergent Tethyan thrust belt in the southwest. Blocks of Tethyan Himalayan strata increase in size and the volumetric proportion of matrix decreases from northeast to southwest. We conclude that no arc-affinity sandstone blocks were incorporated into the subduction complex until India-Asia collision at similar to 59 Ma when the Xigaze forearc basin became overfilled and Tethyan Himalayan strata entered the trench. As collision progressed, there was a gradual transition in structural style from block-in-matrix melange formation to imbricate-style thrust belt formation.

   abstract = {This article reports the results of field mapping and the petrology of clastic rocks in the Dabure area, southern Qiangtang, Tibet, together with the results of U-Pb dating of detrital zircons from these rocks. The Dabure clastic rocks are characterized by low compositional and textural maturity, and they have been affected by lower greenschist facies metamorphism. The deposits exhibit the typical features of turbidites. Altogether, 279 detrital zircons were selected for U-Pb dating, and the ages fall into five groups: 550-650, similar to 800, 900-1100, 1600-1800, and 2300-2500Ma. In general, the ages of the detrital zircons that are older than similar to 550Ma are similar to those found elsewhere in the southern Qiangtang and Himalayan terranes. The most reliable youngest age of a detrital zircon from the Dabure clastic rocks is similar to 550Ma. In the southern part of the Tibet Plateau, strata with the same ages and lithologies as the Dabure clastic rocks are widespread, especially in the Himalayan terrane. Combining our data with previous work on the basalts in the Dabure area (the Dabure basalts), we tentatively suggest that the Dabure clastic rocks represent the late Ediacaran (similar to 550Ma) sedimentary record for the Qiangtang terrane, and that before the late Neoproterozoic the southern Qiangtang terrane was possibly connected to the Himalayan terrane.},

   abstract = {Detrital zircons (DZ) and Nd isotopic characteristics constraint maximum depositional ages of two distinct Paleoproterozoic and Neoproterozoic terranes across the Main Central Thrust zone (Munsiari Group) in the Himalaya. New DZ ages and Nd isotopic characters are reported from the Inner Lesser Himalaya (iLH) sedimentary belt (Berinag Group quartzite) and the Munsiari Group through the Great Himalayan Sequence (GHS-Vaikrita Group) across the MCT to the lower parts of the Tethyan Himalayan Sequence (THS) along the Alaknanda-Dhauli Ganga valleys, Uttarakhand Himalaya. The iLH Berinag Group quartzite yielded nearly unimodal DZ U-Pb ages between 2.05 and 1.80 Ga with epsilon(Nd(0)) values of -17 and -23, while the overthrust Munsiari Group, bounded by the Munsiari Thrust at the base and the Vaikrita Thrust (MCT) at the top, represents the Proterozoic magmatic arc with similar to 1.95 and 1.89 Ga U-Pb zircon age population with an average of -25 epsilon(Nd(0)) value; the arc developed during the Columbia Supercontinent assembly. In contrast, overthrust Great Himalayan Sequence (GHS-Vaikrita Group) above the MCT is characterized by entirely new Neoproterozoic 1.05-0.85 Ga zircon population, which appears for the first time in this sequence, and has higher epsilon(Nd(0)) values (average -16). Tectonically overlying the GHS, the Tethyan Himalayan Sequence (THS) has first appearance of the Early Paleozoic detrital zircons, with its epsilon(Nd(0)) values like the GHS. Broadly, these characters persist throughout the Himalayan belt from Himachal to NE Himalaya. The iLH sediments were possibly derived from northernly similar to 1.9 Ga magmatic arc, and southern the Archean-Proterozoic Aravalli-Bundelkhand nuclei of the Indian craton. Potential sources for the GHS sediments may be a northerly 'destroyed' Neoproterozoic magmatic arc whose remnants exists within the Himalaya as the Neoproterozoic granitoids, and possibly be the iLH sedimentary belt, an 'In-board' Aravalli-Delhi Fold Belt (ADFB)-Central Indian Tectonic Zone (CITZ) in the south.

   abstract = {The Himalayan orogen is a type example of continent-continent collision. Knowledge of the timing of India-Asia collision is critical to the calculation of the amount of convergence that must have been accommodated and thus to models of crustal deformation. Sedimentary rocks on the Indian plate near the suture zone can be used to constrain the time of collision by determining first evidence of Asian derived material deposited on the Indian plate. However, in the Himalaya, for this approach to be applied successfully, it is necessary to be able to distinguish between Asian detritus and detritus from oceanic island arcs that may have collided with India prior to India-Asia collision. Zircons from the Indian plate, Asian plate and Kohistan-Ladakh Island arc can be distinguished based on their U-Pb ages combined with Hf signatures. We undertook a provenance study of the youngest detrital sedimentary rocks of the Tethyan Himalaya of the Indian plate, in the Western Himalaya. We show that zircons of Asian affinity were deposited on the Indian plate at 54 Ma. We thus constrain terminal India-Asia collision, when both sutures north and south of the Kohistan-Ladakh Island arc were closed, to have occurred in the Western Himalaya by 54 Ma.

   abstract = {Cretaceous basins cover large parts of mainland SE Asia. Yet, the development during the Cretaceous is poorly understood including the establishment of the Cretaceous basin configuration. Based on detrital zircon and heavy mineral analysis, this study investigates the provenance of Lower Cretaceous deposits in the Phuquoc Basin, exposed in Cambodia and SW Vietnam and extending into the Gulf of Thailand. Our results document five major zircon populations with 130-145 Ma, 145-200 Ma, 200-270 Ma, 420- 470 Ma, 1800-1900 Ma ages and two subordinate 2400-2700 Ma, 750-1000 Ma age clusters. These ages resemble those of the Qinling-Dabie and the Songpan-Ganzi orogenic belts and differ from other Asian terranes. These ages suggest that the Qinling-Dabie and Songpan-Ganzi orogenic belts were major sources of sediment for the Phuquoc Basin in the Early Cretaceous. Heavy mineral compositions including the presence of almandine, often co-occurring with silimanite and epidote, suggest metamorphic and granitic constituents in the hinterland, compatible with these orogenic belts being the source. The detrital zircon age pattern of the Phuquoc Basin closely resembles the zircon ages in Khorat and the Sichuan basins, suggesting a common sediment source, and bears great similarities with mid-Cretaceous strata in the Lanping-Simao Basin. These basins share a remarkable lithostratigraphic similarity and are confined by erosion. Taken altogether, this supports that the Phuquoc, Khorat, Sichuan, and probably the Lanping-Simao basins, formed part of a Cretaceous basin covering much of central SE Asia segregated by Late Cretaceous and Cenozoic denudation and translation. The absence of 130-145 Ma and 145-200 Ma aged zircons in the Lanping-Simao Basin suggests that another drainage system sprang from the Songpan-Ganzi Orogenic Belt and fed into this basin before merging with the Qinling-Dabie Orogenic Belt drainage system south of the Sichuan Basin. The combined drainage system likely passed through the Khorat Basin before entering the Phuquoc Basin.

   volume = {210},
   abstract = {The North Tianshan Belt (NTB) formed by the subduction and accretion of the Junggar Ocean is a key area for reconstructing the Paleozoic tectonic evolution of the southern Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB). Despite numerous studies, the interpretation of the late Paleozoic tectonic evolution of the NTB meets no consensus yet. We conducted field investigations and LA-ICP-MS zircon U-Pb dating on metamorphic rocks from the Julideneng Metamorphic Complex (JMC) in the Harlik Range, which is located between the Turpan-Hami Basin to the south and the East Junggar Belt to the north. The metamorphic rocks are exposed in a NW-SE striking,-10 km-wide belt and mainly composed of migmatites, garnet-sillimanite mica schists, andalusite schists, and low-grade meta sandstones. Detrital zircons from the low-grade meta-sandstone yielded ages of 1400?1250, 1000?850,-780,-580,-490,-445 and-425 Ma. Three micaschists contain zircon populations of 2500?2175, 1800?1600, 1500?1100, 1000?850, 800?500,-475,-425, 420?380,-346 Ma, and a youngest age peak at-322 Ma. Two samples of leucocratic dykes in migmatites yielded comparable age populations with two major peaks at 322 Ma and 297 Ma, which are interpreted as two stages of successive partial melting and anatectic melts crystallization. On the basis of structural features, zircon textures and U-Pb ages, combined with already published data, we propose that: (1) the meta-sedimentary rocks of the JMC were deposited after 425 Ma and before 322 Ma (latest Silurian to late Carboniferous); (2) the Precambrian detrital zircons in the meta-sedimentary rocks were probably derived from the Central Tianshan Block, which was once connected with the NTB; and (3) the migmatization and coeval granitic plutonism occurred at-322?297 Ma (late Carboniferous), most likely associated with crustal thinning resulted from continent-based intra-arc or back-arc or post-orogenic extension.},

   abstract = {South Qinling is a tectonic block in the Mesozoic Qinling orogenic belt, central China, which is generally believed to have had tight affinity with the Yangtze Block during Precambrian times. In recent years, it has been recognized that the South Qinling Block hosts several Precambrian basement complexes. Here we report U-Pb ages and Hf isotopic data for zircons and Sr-Nd isotopic data for whole-rocks of the Douling complex, the oldest rock unit exposed in South Qinling, to reveal the early evolution of this basement. The Douling complex mainly consists of paragneisses and granitic orthogneisses. Zircons of magmatic origin from three orthogneiss samples give U-Pb ages of c. 2.5 Ga, suggesting an early Paleoproterozoic magmatic activity. Zircon Hf isotopic compositions imply the growth of juvenile crust since c. 3.0 Ga. The magmatic activity at c. 2.5 Ga points to differences in the Precambrian history between South Qinling and the Archean Kongling terrene, the oldest basement of the Yangtze Block. Three paragneiss samples contain complex detrital zircons of different ages and origins. Their U-Pb ages mainly cluster around 2.5 Ga, 2.0 Ga, 1.5 Ga and 800 Ma. Zircon grains with ages of 2.0 Ga and 800 Ma have low Th/U ratios and no oscillatory zoning, implying two episodes of metamorphic overprint. Such Paleoproterozoic metamorphic event has also been traced in the Yangtze Block, confirming its close relationship with South Qinling. The record of Neoproterozoic amphibolite-facies metamorphism in detrital zircons suggest that the tectonic transition from convergent to extensional environments in the Yangtze Block must have occurred later than 800 Ma ago.

   abstract = {The Paleo-Asian Ocean (PAO) has been regarded as a long-lived ocean from Neoproterozoic to early Mesozoic, and its subduction and closure built the Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB), the largest accretionary orogenic belt in Earth's history. Although the tectonic evolution of the PAO has been discussed from diverse perspectives, the spatiotemporal dynamics in the evolution of the main branch of the PAO and its relationship with the Tethys remain contentious partly because of the absence of sedimentary evidence. Specifically, as far as the Beishan Orogenic Collage (BOC) in the southernmost part of CAOB is concerned, there remain at least two key questions: how did the BOC evolve tectonically and paleogeographically through the late Paleozoic; and which ophiolitic belt represented the main branch of the PAO in the BOC? This study recognized 27 volcano-sedimentary microfacies and 14 facies associations (FAs) in nine measured Carboniferous-Permian sections from the southern BOC. FA changes in the Visean-Capitanian megasequence indicate a Visean-Moscovian regressive sequence from fore-reef slopes to tidal flats and an Artinskian-Wordian transgressive sequence from fan-deltas to abyssal plains, separated by a continental and volcanic sequence straddling the Gzhelian-Sakmarian interval. Characteristics and lateral correlation of FAs suggest an epicontinental sea during Visean-Moscovian times, followed by a marine rift basin which eventually developed into a proto-oceanic basin during the Artinskian-Wordian. Paleobiogeographic evidence further suggests that this epicontinental sea was closely linked with the Tethyan oceans. Statistical comparisons of detrital zircon ages based on data compiled from previous and the present studies supports that this sea was mainly fed from Neoproterozoic and Ordovician-Silurian rocks (ca. 983 and 425 Ma) with a sparse influx of Mesoproterozoic and Paleoproterozoic detritus (ca. 2492, 1449, and 1302 Ma). During the Artinskian-Wordian, the rift basin was connected with the PAO based on the mixed cool- and warm-temperate marine faunas of the Boreal and Tethyan realms. This rift basin is thought to have been fed by two source-to-sink provenance systems, from either Ordovician-Silurian or Early Permian rocks (ca. 450 or 277 Ma), although provenance signatures were mixed because of turbidity and other currents in deep marine environments. We thus propose a succession of Carboniferous-Permian paleogeographic reconstruction maps for the BOC based on FA correlation and paleobiogeographic features. In these reconstruction models, the PAO is inferred to have been composed of a main branch (an oceanic basin) in the northern BOC as a part of the North Tianshan-Hongshishan-Solonker-Hegenshan Ocean and an epicontinental sea that subsequently evolved into a marine rift basin in the southern BOC.},

   abstract = {The Shingai Unit in the Kurosegawa Belt is subdivided into sedimentary zone and melange zone. Sandstones of the sedimentary zone vary from lithic wackes to feldspathic arenites in ascending stratigraphic order. However, the timing of this change and the depositional ages are not constrained. U-Pb age spectra for detrital zircons from sandstone samples have main clusters of late Paleozoic-earliest Mesozoic ages and minor Proterozoic-early Paleozoic age components. Detrital zircon ages show that the depositional age of the Shingai Unit is Early Triassic and that these grains were derived mainly from igneous rocks and hornfels of the Paleo-Ryoke Belt and from rocks of the Kurosegawa Belt. These age data combined with sandstone compositions and stratigraphic relationship suggest that basement rocks in the Kurosegawa Belt constituted the provenance area for the lower Shingai Unit before uplift of the volcanic arc, the provenance subsequently changed to a volcanic arc either because these rocks had been completely eroded or the supply of sediment derived from the volcanic arc increased. This provenance change supports progressive denudation of the volcanic arc. By comparison with the detrital age spectra, upper Permian-Lower Triassic strata in the Kurosegawa and South Kitakami belts are considered to have the same provenance. In addition, the sedimentary environment of these strata is inferred to have been a trench and shelf adjacent to an island arc that was isolated from the Sino-Korean and South China blocks by a back-arc basin.},

   abstract = {Located on the southern margin of the Lhasa terrane in southern Tibet, the Xigaze forearc basin records Cretaceous to lower Eocene sedimentation along the southern margin of Asia, prior to and during the initial stages of continental collision with the Tethyan Himalaya in the Early Eocene. We present new measured stratigraphic sections, totalling 4.5km stratigraphic thickness, from a 60km E-W segment of the western portion of the Xigaze forearc basin, northeast of the Lopu Kangri Range (29.8007 degrees N, 84.91827 degrees E). In addition, we apply U-Pb detrital zircon geochronology to constrain the provenance and maximum depositional ages of investigated strata. Stratigraphic ages range between ca. 88 and ca. 54Ma and sedimentary facies indicate a shoaling-upward trend from deep-marine turbidites to fluvial deposits. Depositional environments of coeval Cretaceous strata along strike include deep-marine distal turbidites, slope-apron debris-flow deposits and marginal marine carbonates. This along-strike variability in facies suggests an irregular paleogeography of the Asian margin prior to collision. Paleocene-Eocene strata are composed of shallow marine carbonates with abundant foraminifera such as Nummulites-Discocyclina and Miscellanea-Daviesina and transition into fluvial deposits dated at ca. 54Ma. Sandstone modal analyses, conglomerate clast compositions and detrital zircon U-Pb geochronology indicate that forearc detritus in this region was derived solely from the Gangdese magmatic arc to the north. In addition, U-Pb detrital zircon age spectra within the upper Xigaze forearc stratigraphy are similar to those from Eocene foreland basin strata south of the Indus-Yarlung suture near Sangdanlin, suggesting that the Xigaze forearc was a possible source of Sangdanlin detritus by ca. 55Ma. We propose a model in which the Xigaze forearc prograded south over the accretionary prism and onto the advancing Tethyan Himalayan passive margin between 58 and 54Ma, during late stage evolution of the forearc basin and the beginning of collision with the Tethyan Himalaya. The lack of documented forearc strata younger than ca. 51Ma suggests that sedimentation in the forearc basin ceased at this time owing to uplift resulting from continued continental collision.},

Our aim is to constrain the provenance and tectonic settings of these strata. The detrital zircons in these rocks are dominantly Neoproterozoic in age (similar to 80% of all zircons), along with some Mesoproterozoic and Paleoproterozoic zircons, and the main age peaks are at ca. 1.78, 1.64, 1.45, 1.18, 0.94, and 0.82 Ga. The zircon Hf and whole-rock Sm-Nd isotopic compositions, together with geochronological data, show that the main sources of the Cambrian sediments were Neoproterozoic and Mesoproterozoic igneous complexes formed by the reworking of Paleoproterozoic rocks. The main age populations of detrital zircons from the Cambrian siltstones in the Bureya Massif are similar to those of detrital zircons from the Neoproterozoic and early Paleozoic deposits within the Jiamusi Massif, suggesting that they share a common history. However, the crustal basements of the Bureya and Jiamusi massifs are different from those of other massifs in the eastern part of the CAOB, such as the Erguna, Khanka, Khingan, and Songnen-Zhangguangcai Range massifs. The wide Neoproterozoic magmatic events suggest that the Bureya and Jiamusi massifs have an affinity to the Tarim Craton or the northern Tian Shan block, different from the North Asian and North China cratons.},

The occurrence and age of the magmatism is presented in this study as well as the maximum age of deposition for some Late Mesozoic lithostratigraphic units. Geochronological studies on zircon and monazite was carried out to unravel the Late Mesozoic tectonic evolution of this area. Monazite U-Th-total Pb dating was used to determine the age of the Daroctan Granite, which yielded a Late Cretaceous age similar to some of the Mesozoic granites surrounding the South China Sea. Zircon U-Pb and monazite U-Th-total Pb dating were also used to determine the maximum age of deposition of the sedimentary units belonging to the Guinlo Formation and Tumarbong Semi-schist. The results show a Jurassic to Early Cretaceous age range with a Late Cretaceous maximum age of deposition for the meta-sedimentary units. This sliver of the Palawan Continental Block, which is composed of accreted units, might have been located at the margin of the continent-ocean collision during the Mesozoic wherein detrital minerals with mostly Late Cretaceous ages were deposited. It was later intruded by the Daroctan Granite and eventually broke off from the southeastern Eurasian margin. These findings provide additional constraints on the tectonic evolution of the Palawan Continental Block. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {The Liiliang Mountains, located at the western margin of the Trans-North China Orogen, are thought to have undergone several uplift events during the late Mesozoic and Cenozoic due to far field effects of the India Eurasia collision and/or Pacific Plate subduction. However, the timing and mechanisms of late Cenozoic uplift of the Liiliang Mountains are not clear. Our investigation of the source characteristics of the Shilou red clay sequence, an eolian deposit on the eastern Chinese Loess Plateau adjacent to the Lilliang Mountains, provides a new understanding of the relationship between the material composition of the eolian sediment and regional tectonic activity. Grain size data for the Shilou red clay sequence reveal an abrupt increase at ca. 5.7 Ma, and U Pb detrital zircon geochronology indicates that the major source areas of Shilou red clay shifted after ca. 5.7 Ma, from the Junggar Basin, western Mu Us desert, and Gobi-Alxa arid lands, to the eastern Mu Us desert and the Liiliang Mountains. Detrital zircons younger than 5.7 Ma in the Shilou red clay have similar U and Th contents to zircons from the Liiliang Mountains, indicating that the mountains acted as a proto-source for the red clay after ca. 5.7 Ma. We suggest that the influx of coarser grained sediment is due to rapid uplift of the Liiliang Mountains at ca. 5.7 Ma, and that this timing is consistent with northeastward propagation of mountain uplift in response to the India Eurasia collision.},

   abstract = {Forearc basins preserve the geologic record relating strictly to arc magmatism. The provenance of forearc sediment can be used to differentiate periods of crustal growth, accretion, and destruction, enhanced magmatism, advancing and retreating subduction slabs, delamination, etc. These tectonic systems predict differing degrees of sedimentary reworking of the older forearc units. Additionally, Hf isotopes of zircon can be used to evaluate the degree of continental reworking that occurs in the arc system. In this paper, we evaluate the changes in a long-lived subduction system using detrital zircon U-Pb and Hf-isotope data from forearc units in northern Honshu, Japan that span in age from the Silurian Period to the present from the forearc provenance of the Japanese subduction system. Our data demonstrate a series of dominant age peaks (430 +/- 20, 360 +/- 10, 270 +/- 20, 184 +/- 12, 112 +/- 22, and 7 +/- 7 Ma) and a progressive loss of the older zircon populations. Zircon Hf-isotope data reveal three discrete shifts that correspond to differing degrees of isotopic enrichment and correlate with changes in the dominant zircon age peaks. Additionally, each temporal isotopic shift is associated with isolation of the older sedimentary packages wherein no detrital zircon from the previous stages are observed in subsequent stages. We propose these shifts provide evidence for rapid shifts in arc tectonics including magmatic flare-ups, producing the dominant peaks; protracted tectonic erosion progressively removing older sources of zircon reveals a late Carboniferous event triggering the complete removal of the Precambrian crust; and the Cretaceous melting of the entire Permian arc crust, likely related with the subduction of the mid-oceanic ridge separating the Izanagi and Pacific plates.

Despite its significance in constraining regional tectonic evolution, the emplacement time of the Hegenshan ophiolite is still under debate. In this study, we provide new detrital zircon ages of the Paleozoic sedimentary rocks that unconformably overlie the Wusinihei ophiolite (northeastern part of the Hegenshan ophiolite) to constrain the lower limit emplacement time of the Hegenshan ophiolite. The zircon ages obtained from the Paleozoic sedimentary rocks range from 298 8 to 363 +/- 7 Ma, and show bimodal distribution at 300-320 Ma (peak at 308 Ma) and 320-360 Ma (peak at 330 Ma). The age group of 300-320 Ma coincides with the age range of the volcanic rocks of the Late Paleozoic Gegenaobao Formation. The age group of 320-360 Ma with a peak at 330 Ma may be linked to local mafic-ultramafic rocks of the Hegenshan ophiolite. Accordingly, we suggest that the emplacement time of the Hegenshan ophiolite should have occurred earlier than the deposition of the Gegenaobao Formation, most likely during the time between 308 and 330 Ma, instead of the Silurian, Devonian or Mesozoic as previously considered.

   abstract = {The Longmu Co-Shuanghu suture zone, which divides the Qiangtang terrane into the northern and southern Qiangtang blocks, is regarded as a key locality in reconstructing the evolutionary history of the Palaeo-Tethys Ocean and the break-up of Gondwana. However, although low-temperature - high-pressure metamorphic rocks and ophiolites have been documented within the Longmu Co-Shuanghu suture zone, it remains unclear whether it is an in situ suture zone and represents the relic of the main Palaeo-Tethys Ocean. The uncertainty stems mainly from the limited systematic studies of the provenance, palaeontological evidence and depositional settings of strata on either side of the Longmu Co-Shuanghu suture zone (i.e. northern and southern Qiangtang blocks). Here we report new detrital zircon U-Pb ages and palaeontological data from Lower Carboniferous strata (Riwanchaka Formation) of the northern Qiangtang block, central Tibet. The Riwanchaka Formation contains warm-climate biota with Cathaysian affinities. Provenance analysis reveals that the formation has detrital zircon spectra similar to those from strata of the Yangtze Plate, and it contains a large proportion of zircons with ages (similar to 360 Ma) similar to the timing of synsedimentary magmatic arc activity, implying an active continental margin setting associated with northward subduction of the Palaeo-Tethyan oceanic lithosphere. Conversely, the Carboniferous-Permian strata from the southern Qiangtang block contain cool-water faunas of Gondwanan affinity and exhibit minimum zircon crystallization ages that are markedly older than their depositional ages, suggesting a passive continental margin setting. The differences in provenance, palaeontological assemblages and depositional settings of the Carboniferous to Permian strata either side of the Longmu Co-Shuanghu suture zone indicate the existence of an ancient ocean between the northern and southern Qiangtang blocks. Combining the new findings with previous studies on high-pressure metamorphic rocks, arc magmatism and ophiolites, we support the interpretation that the Longmu Co-Shuanghu suture zone is an in situ suture zone that represents the main suture of the Palaeo-Tethys Ocean.},

Nowadays, there are few discussion on the Caledonian tectonothermal events of the Zhongwunongshan Structural Belt, and there exist different opinions on provenance and tectonic environment of the Zhongwunongshan Group in the ZWSB and its adjacent North Qaidam. In this study, a comprehensive analysis of the detrital zircon geochronological research was carried out on the Zhongwunongshan Group. The detrital zircon U-Pb dating results showed two major populations. The first was Neoproterozoic (966-725 Ma) with a epsilon Hf(t) = -15.9 to 9.5, and the other was late Early Paleozoic (460-434Ma) with a epsilon Hf(t) = -9.6 to -3.1. In combination with previous research, the dominated provenances were found to be the Neoproterozoic granitic gneiss of the Yuqia-Shaliuhe HP-UHP metamorphic belt and the late Early Paleozoic granite of the Tanjianshan ophiolite-volcanic arc belt in North Qaidam. The Zhongwunongshan Group was deposited in the back-arc sedimentary basin related to the Caledonian collisional orogeny during Middle Silurian-Early Devonian (434-407.9 Ma).},

   abstract = {In order to advance our understanding of the suturing process between continental landmasses, a geologic and geochronologic investigation was undertaken just south of the India-Asia suture in southwestern Tibet. The focus of this study, the Xiao Gurla Range, is located near the southeastern terminus of the active, right-lateral strike-slip Karakoram fault in southwestern Tibet. The range exposes metasandstone, phyllite, schist (locally of sillimanite facies), calc-gneiss and marble, paragneiss (+/- pyroxene), quartzite, metagranite, and variably deformed leucogranite. These metamorphic rocks are exposed in the footwall of a domal, top-to-the-west low-angle normal (detachment) fault, structurally beneath Neogene-Quaternary basin fill and serpentinized ultramafic rocks of the Kiogar-Jungbwa ophiolite. The detachment is interpreted to be the northeastern continuation of the Gurla Mandhata detachment fault system that bounds metamorphic rocks of the Curia Mandhata Range similar to 60 km to the southwest. U-Pb geochronology on five detrital zircon samples of schist, phyllite, and quartzite yielded maximum depositional ages that range from 644-363 Ma and age probability distributions that are more similar to Tethyan sequence rocks than Lesser Himalayan sequence rocks. A felsic gneiss yielded a metamorphic zircon age of 35.3 +/- 0.8 Ma with a significant population of early Paleozoic xenocrystic core ages. The gneiss is interpreted to be the metamorphosed equivalent of the Cambro-Ordovician gneiss that is exposed near the top of the Greater Himalayan sequence. Leucogranitic bodies intruding metasedimentary footwall rocks yielded two distinct U-Pb zircon ages of similar to 23 Ma and similar to 15 Ma. Locally, rocks exposed in the hanging wall of this fault and of the southward-dipping, northward-verging Great Counter thrust to the north consist of serpentinite-bearing melange and conglomerate of inferred Paleogene age dominated by carbonate clasts. The melange is intruded by a 44 Ma granite and the stratigraphically highest conglomerate unit yielded detrital zircon U-Pb ages similar to Tethyan sequence rocks. We attribute the middle Eocene magmatism south of the suture to break-off of the Neo-Tethyan oceanic slab. In addition, our observations are consistent with the late Eocene shortening and crustal thickening within the Tethyan Himalayan sequence, early-middle Miocene leucogranite emplacement being related to underthrusting and melting of the Greater and possibly Lesser Himalayan sequences, and late Miocene arc-parallel extension in the hinterland of the southward propagating Himalayan thrust belt.

   abstract = {The Chinese Loess Plateau of central Asia is composed of interbedded loess and paleosol layers, deposited during glacial and interglacial cycles, respectively, during the past similar to 2.5 m.y. Understanding the provenance of loess is fundamental to reconstructing wind patterns during Quaternary glacial periods. We determined and compared U-Pb ages on zircon crystals from Loess Plateau strata and potential source areas. The results indicate that the loess was largely derived from the Qaidam Basin and the northern Tibetan Plateau to the west, both of which exhibit spatially extensive geomorphic landforms indicative of past (interpreted as pre-Holocene) wind erosion and/or deflation by westerly winds. This challenges the current paradigm that the loess of the Chinese Loess Plateau was largely sourced from deserts located to the northwest, as observed in the modern interglacial climate. We propose that during glacial periods, the mean annual positions of the polar jet streams were shifted equatorward, resulting in more southerly tracks for dust-generating storms and suppression of the East Asian monsoon by inhibiting the subtropical jet from shifting northward across the Tibetan Plateau.},

   abstract = {This study documented the field relationship and integrated provenance of a clastic sequence exposed at the Mesozoic-Cenozoic boundary located in Changla Gali section, Lesser Himalaya, Pakistan, to provide an insight into Cretaceous tectonics of the northern Indian margin. This boundary sequence is represented by the Early Palaeocene Hangu Formation, which consists of shales in the lower part and sandstone in the upper part. The contact relationship of the Early Palaeocene Hangu Formation with the underlying Late Cretaceous Kawagarh Formation is marked by an angular unconformity. The detrital zircons extracted from the shale and sandstone samples shows a major age cluster, which varies between similar to 700 and similar to 1,100 Ma (45%), similar to 1,600 and similar to 1,900 Ma (15%), and similar to 480 and similar to 590 Ma. Additionally, two minor age clusters of the detrital zircons are identified, that is, similar to 2,300-2,500 Ma and similar to 600-700 Ma. The younger detrital zircon grains have ages of 298 +/- 4 Ma, 297 +/- 4 Ma and 116 +/- 3 Ma. This age pattern reflect the major source area as the Indian Plate. The two younger Permian zircon grains may be derived from the Panjal mafic volcanic rocks exposed in the vicinity of the study area. However, a single Cretaceous grain may be attributed to ophiolites, as well as Tethyan Himalayan (TH) volcanic rocks. Similarly, the sandstone petrographic results show that the sandstones are quartz-rich, which show derivation from the craton interior provenance, which is likely the Indian Plate. However, the trace element data suggest a mixed source consisting of felsic and mafic rocks. The contribution of the mafic source is likely associated with the Panjal mafic rocks exposed along the northern Indian margin. The field relationship shows that the underlying Mesozoic sequence is folded prior to the deposition of the Hangu Formation. This folding suggests that the northern Indian margin experienced a regional compression during the Late Cretaceous time, which folded the Mesozoic sequence before the resumption of sedimentation during the Palaeocene. Furthermore, the detrital zircon provenance suggests that the sediments were mainly derived from the Indian Plate. Combining the results, it can be concluded that the compressional event is likely associated with the Late Cretaceous ophiolite obduction onto the leading edge of the Indian Plate. However, the absence of the major ophiolitic age component in the detrital record may suggest that the ophiolites were emplaced over the northern Indian margin but remained submerged during Early Palaeocene time.},

   abstract = {We carried U-Pb-Hf geochronology of the clastic sequence covering upper Mesozoic-Cenozoic period. The upper Mesozoic sequence is overlain unconformably by the Cenozoic strata, marking regional K-T boundary, which is mapped as angular unconformity. This angular relationship may strongly indicate a compressional orogenic event that occurred during the Late Cretaceous. Late Cretaceous Kohistan-Karakoram collision and ophiolite emplacement may account for the development of this compression along the northern Indian margin. The U-Pb-Hf isotopic analyses of the upper Mesozoic and lower Cenozoic sequence (Hangu Formation and Lower Patala Formation) are similar to the Tethyan and Lesser Himalayan signatures, which indicate the Indian-plate provenance. The two younger Cretaceous grains recorded in the Hangu Formation might be derived from the Indian-plate volcanic rocks and/or Tethyan Himalayan volcanic rocks. The absence of ophiolitic age component in the precollision sequence may indicate that these ophiolites are not exposed until final India-Eurasia collision. The major shift in provenance is recorded in the upper part of the Patala Formation, where the presence of disconformity and the appearance of <100 Ma detrital zircons indicate the contribution of Eurasian source (i.e., Kohistan-Ladakh arc; KLA), which is further supported by the Hf(t) signatures. Upsection, the contribution from Eurasian source increased in the Early Middle Eocene Kuldana Formation. Therefore, we suggest that the provenance mixing close to Paleocene-Eocene boundary indicates that the India-Eurasia collision in the north Pakistan occurred at approximate to 56-55 Ma and subsequent exhumation increased the contribution of the northern (Eurasian) provenance in the upsection.},

Two diamictite units occur in the Neoproterozoic sedimentary successions on the western margin of Cathaysia Block.

Paleocurrent data indicate sediment transport to the northwest. The timing and character of the ages of detrital zircons match the records of North India and East Antarctica, indicating that the Cathaysia Block received detritus from Gondwana. Thus, South China lay adjacent to northern Gondwana since at least 720 Ma, and possibly considerably earlier.},

   abstract = {Neoproterozoic paleogeography of the South China is dominated by the formation of Rodinia, its break-up, and the subsequent amalgamation of Gondwana. Two negative excursions of the chemical index of alteration (CIA) and the chemical index of weathering (CIW) recorded in the Cryogenian to Ediacaran sedimentary rocks of the Cathaysia Block, South China, indicate two cooling events. In combination with available age constraints, this data suggests correlation with the global Marinoan (ca. 650-635 Ma) and Gaskiers (ca. 579 Ma) glaciations. U-Pb ages of detrital zircons from the Cryogenian to lower Ediacaran strata define two distinctive age peaks at 1056 Ma and 998 Ma, whereas the upper Ediacaran strata show only one age peak at 957 Ma. These data demonstrate Neoproterozoic sedimentary rocks in the Cathaysia Block were derived from a source external to the craton. The predominant late Mesoproterozoic to early Neoproterozoic (1140-870 Ma) detrital zircons were most likely derived from a source dominated by North India and East Antarctica with limited input from Western Australia. Furthermore, epsilon(Hf)(t) values of detrital zircons are similar to the coeval detrital zircons from RaynerEastern Ghats. The detrital record of the late Cryogenian and Ediacaran strata in the Cathaysia Block suggests that the South China Block was connected to the northern margin of India during the dispersal of Rodinia and the assembly of East Gondwana. Detrital zircons from Cryogenian strata overlying the Jiangnan Orogen are largely in the range 900-700 Ma with scattered Archean and Paleoproterozoic grains. These ages are consistent with derivation from local sources within South China. The timing of accumulation of these units, after collisional assembly of South China, likely accounts for their more restricted provenance with collision generated relief providing both a local source and restricting input from further south within India and/or the rest of Gondwana.},

   abstract = {The tectonic affinity of mid - late Neoprotemzoic magmatism in the South China Block provides a first order constraint on its role in the break-up of Rodinia and the subsequent amalgamation of Gondwana. The Yingyangguan area in the western margin of Cathaysia Block preserves a magmatic and sedimentary record of this period. U-Pb zircon age data indicate magmatism at around 750 Ma, followed by accumulation of a succession of tuff and carbonate rocks at ca. 670-660 Ma. All samples show evidence for ductile deformation and metamorphism. The geochemical characteristics of mid-Neoproterozoic mafic and intermediate rocks suggest crustal assimilation and fractional crystallization play an important role in magma evolution, and they were derived from a source dominated by modified lithospheric mantle sources previously metasomatized by slab-derived fluids. Analyzed samples, as well as contemporaneous mafic rocks in neighboring areas, have high Zr/Y ratios, and plot in the within-plate basalt field at ca. 750 Ma. In addition, zircons with ages between 1200 and 950 Ma and 850-770 Ma mostly fall within the arc-related field on discriminating diagrams based on zircon trace-element compositions, whereas, most ca. 750 Ma and 700-600 Ma zircons plot in the within-plate field. This evolving tectonic record of magmatic activity suggests a transformation from a convergent plate margin setting on the periphery of Rodinia to one involving within plate extension at ca. 750 Ma. Furthermore, the detrital zircons from samples of the Yingyangguan Group present abundant late Mesoproterozoic to early Neoproterozoic (1200-950 Ma) ages. These ages match the record of North India and Indo-Antarctica, and imply a peripheral setting for South China with respect to the supercontinent and most likely adjacent to India from at least 750 Ma. Thus, we suggest that the Yangtze Block accreted to Cathaysia on the northern margin of India in the early Neoproterozoic, and that the active plate boundaries located along the northern and western margins of South China continue to ca. 750 Ma. After this time, the tectonic setting within the South China Block transformed into a stable within-plate siliciclastic depositional environment that continued to receive detritus from East Gondwana until the early Devonian.},

Synorogenic stratigraphic sequences of Late Triassic to Early-Middle Jurassic age were developed in the northern Yangtze foreland basin. The upper Middle Jurassic Shaximiao Formation consists mainly of thick-bedded terrestrial successions that serve as the main body of the basin-filling sequences, suggesting intense tectonism in the peripheral orogeny of the foreland basin. Laser-ICP-MS U-Pb analysis of 254 detrital zircon grains from sandstone samples and several published Lower-Middle Jurassic samples, detrital compositions, petrofacies, and paleocurrent reconstructions in the northern Yangtze foreland basin indicate that discrete source areas included the Qinling-Dabieshan ranges and the Mianlue suture zone to the north, and the South China plate to the south. The stratigraphic succession and sediment provenance of the foreland basin imply that the early Mianlue oceanic basin, magmatic arc, and nonmarine molasse foreland basin during the period of deposition were modified or buried by the subsequent continent-continent collision between the North China-Qinling-Dabieshan plate and the Yangtze plate during the Jurassic, which followed the oblique amalgamation between these plates during the Middle-Late Triassic.

   abstract = {The formation and evolution of an intrac-ontinental basin triggered via the subduction or collision of plates at continental margins can record intracontinental tectonic pro-cesses. As a typical intracontinental basin during the Jurassic, the Qaidam Basin in western China records how this extensional basin formed and evolved in response to dis -tant subduction or collisional processes and tectonism caused by stresses transmitted from distant convergent plate margins. The Jurassic evolution of the Qaidam Basin, in terms of basin-filling architecture, sediment dispersal pattern and basin properties, re-mains speculative; hence, these uncertainties need to be revisited. An integrated study of the stratigraphic succession, conglomerates, U-Pb geochronology, and Hf isotopes of de-trital zircons was adopted to elucidate the Jurassic evolutionary process of the Qaidam Basin. The results show that a discrete Juras-sic terrestrial succession characterized by alluvial fan, braided stream, braided river delta, and lacustrine deposits developed on the western and northern margins of the Qaidam Basin. The stratigraphic succession, U-Pb age dating, and Hf isotope analysis, along with the reconstructed provenance results, suggest small-scale distribution of Lower Jurassic sediments deposited via au-tochthonous sedimentation on the western margin of the basin, with material mainly originating from the Altyn Tagh Range. Lower Jurassic sediments in the western seg-ment of the northern basin were shed from the Qilian Range (especially the South Qilian) and Eastern Kunlun Range. And coeval sedi-ments in the eastern segment of the northern basin were originated from the Quanji mas-sif. During the Middle-Late Jurassic, the pri-mary source areas were the Qilian Range and Eastern Kunlun Range, which fed material to the whole basin. The Jurassic sedimentary environment in the Qaidam Basin evolved from a series of small-scale, scattered, and rift-related depressions distributed on the western and northern margins during the Early Jurassic to a larger, extensive, and uni-fied depression occupying the whole basin in the Middle Jurassic. The Altyn Tagh Range rose to a certain extent during the Early Ju-rassic but lacked large-scale strike-slip tecto-nism throughout the Jurassic. At that time, the North Qaidam tectonic belt had not yet been uplifted and did not shed material into the basin during the Jurassic. The Qaidam Basin experienced intracontinental exten-sional tectonism with a northeast-southwest trend throughout the Jurassic in response to far-field effects driven by the sequential northward or northeastward amalgamation of blocks to the southern margin of the Qa-idam Block and successive accretion of the Qiangtang Block and Lhasa Block onto the southern Eurasian margin during the Late Triassic-Early Jurassic and Late Jurassic- Early Cretaceous, respectively.},

   abstract = {The Maoniushan Formation in the northern part of the North Qaidam Orogen (NQO), NW China, contains key information on a Paleozoic change in tectonic setting of the NQO from compression to extension. Here, new zircon U-Pb, petrological, and sedimentological data for the lower molasse sequence of the Maoniushan Formation are used to constrain the timing of this tectonic transition. Detrital zircons yield U-Pb ages of 3.3-0.4 Ga with major populations at 0.53-0.4, 1.0-0.56, 2.5-1.0, and 3.3-2.5 Ga. The maximum depositional age of the Maoniushan Formation is well constrained by a youngest detrital zircon age of similar to 409 Ma. Comparing these dates with geochronological data for the region indicates that Proterozoic-Paleozoic zircons were derived mainly from the NQO as well as the Oulongbuluk and Qaidam blocks, whereas Archean zircons were probably derived from the Oulongbuluk Block and the Tarim Craton. The similar to 924, similar to 463, and similar to 439 Ma tectonothermal events recorded in this region indicate that the NQO was involved in the early Neoproterozoic assembly of Rodinia and early Paleozoic microcontinental convergence. A regional angular unconformity between Devonian and pre-Devonian strata within the NQO suggests a period of strong mountain building between the Oulongbuluk and Qaidam blocks during the Silurian, whereas an Early Devonian post-orogenic molasse, evidence of extensional collapse, and Middle to Late Devonian bimodal volcanic rocks and Carboniferous marine carbonate rocks clearly reflect long-lived tectonic extension. Based on these results and the regional geology, we suggest that the Devonian volcano-sedimentary rocks within the NQO were formed in a post-orogenic extensional setting similar to that of the East Kunlun Orogen, indicating that a major tectonic transition from compression to extension in these two orogens probably commenced in the Early Devonian.},

   abstract = {This study presents new integrated stratigraphic, sedimentary, and geochronological data for Silurian to Devonian sedimentary rocks in the central North Qilian Belt (NQB), NW China. These data constrain the timing and processes involved in the Palaeozoic tectonic transition from compression to extension in the NQB. This study indicates that the Angzanggou Formation probably formed in a foreland basin setting during 439-430 Ma compression associated with the closure of the North Qilian Ocean. The terrestrial sedimentary rocks overlying the formation were most likely deposited in a superimposed basin at 409-388 Ma as a result of the post-orogenic extension of the NQB, an event that involved initial post-orogenic extension-related sedimentation. Silurian-Devonian sediments were derived from multiple sources, including the NQB, Central Qilian Block (CQB), and Alxa and Dunhuang blocks. Convergence between the CQB and the Alxa Block propagated westward, leading to the scissor-like closure of the North Qilian Ocean during the Middle to Late Silurian and the oblique docking and collision of these two blocks. This is evidenced by a lack of middle-upper Silurian sedimentary rocks in the middle and eastern NQB compared with the well-developed and well-preserved sedimentary strata in the western segment. Devonian retrogradation and intracontinental extension-related magmatism in the NQB also provide evidence of long-lived tectonic extension of the lithosphere. Combining these new data with previously published data for the NQB and the wider region suggests that the Devonian terrestrial strata were deposited in a post-orogenic extensional setting similar to that in the North Qaidam and East Kunlun belts, indicating that the Palaeozoic large-scale tectonic transition from compression to extension in these three belts most likely started during the Early Devonian.},

   abstract = {SEDEX sulfide deposits hosted in black shale and carbonate are common in the South China Block. The Dajiangping pyrite deposit is the largest of these deposits and is made up of stratiform orebodies hosted in black shales. Sandstone interlayered with stratiform orebodies contains detrital zircon grains with the youngest ages of 429 Ma. Pyrite from the orebodies has a Re-Os isochron age of 389 +/- 62 Ma, indicative of formation of the hosting strata and syngenetic pyrite ores in the mid-late Devonian. The hosting strata is a transgression sequence in a passive margin and composed of carbonaceous limestone in the lower part and black shales in the upper part. The ore-hosting black shales have high TOC (total organic carbon), Mo, As, Pb, Zn and Cd, indicating an anoxic-euxinic deep basin origin. The high redox proxies, V/(V + Ni) > 0.6 and V/Cr > 1, and the positive correlations of TOC with Mo and V in black shales are also consistent with an anoxic depositional environment. The Dajiangping deposit is located close to the NE-trending Wuchuan-Sihui fault, which was active during the Devonian. The mid-late Devonian mineralization age and the anoxic-euxinic deep basinal condition of this deposit thus imply that the formation of this deposit was causally linked to hydrothermal fluid exhalation in an anoxic fault-bounded basin that developed in a carbonate platform of the South China Block. The regional distribution of many Devonian, stratiform, carbonaceous sediment-hosted sulfide deposits along the NE-trending fault-bounded basins in South China, similar to the Dajiangping deposit, indicates that these deposits formed at a basin developed in the passive margin setting of the South China Block during the Devonian. This environment was caused by the break-up and northward migration of the South China Block from Gandwana.},

   abstract = {Understanding sedimentary routing systems at continental margins can be challenging in tectonically active regions such as forearc basins. Here, we combine sand modal composition and detrital zircon U-Pb data from the Kumano Basin and surrounding Nankai Trough region of Japan to explore sedimentation in an active forearc and its linkages to the regional tectonic history. Our analyses are on Miocene-to-Pleistocene samples collected by the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) at inner and outer forearc basin sites C0009 and C0002, river samples from onshore Honshu, and published results from other Nankai IODP sites. Results show the sediments of many IODP samples are similar to that of the modern rivers. Data from C0009 demonstrate that the early accretionary prism already contained slope basins fed by sediments similar to those in the modern Kumano River by 7.1 Ma. The more distal C0002 section was predominantly fed by a system similar to the modern Yodo River, located to the west-southwest. We conclude that the section was therefore tectonically transported, in agreement with the 'mobile model' of oblique tectonic convergence across SW Japan during late Miocene time. Deposition resumed after a ca. 5.6-3.8 Ma hiatus, with sediments primarily fed from the paleo-Kumano River, with some input from the paleo-Tenryu and Kiso/Nagara rivers located to the northeast. Input from the paleo-Tenryu and Kiso/Nagara rivers was likely re-routed towards the trench by ca. 1.3 Ma. Sediments similar to those of the distal Yodo River also make up part of the Kumano basin fill and are best explained by erosion of uplifted older accretionary prism sediments along the Megasplay Fault that bounds the forearc basin. Despite the temporal variability in sedimentation routed to the basin, basin-fill dynamics appear to have been governed primarily by the critical-wedge style dynamics driven by variations in frontal accretion and in- or out-of-sequence thrusting response.},

   abstract = {The Chinese Tianshan Orogen marks prolonged and complicated interactions between the southwestern Palaeo-Asian Ocean and surrounding blocks. New and previously published detrital zircon chronological data from modern and palaeo-river sands were compiled to reveal its tectonic evolution. It is characterized by predominant Palaeozoic as well as minor Mesozoic and Precambrian detrital zircon ages with a multimodal characteristic. The oldest Phanerozoic zircon population (peaking at 475Ma) is a result of subduction and closure of the early Palaeozoic Terskey Ocean. However, the absence of this peak in the Chinese North and southern South Tianshan suggests that subductions of the North and South Tianshan oceans may not have initiated until the Late Ordovician with subsequent 460-390 and 360-320Ma arc magmatism. Similar to the magmatic suite in classic collisional orogens, the youngest massive 320-270Ma magmatism is suggested to be post-collisional. The North and South Tianshan oceans therefore probably had their closure to form the Chinese Tianshan Orogen during the late Carboniferous. The weak Mesozoic intra-plate magmatism further rejects a late Permian-Triassic Tianshan Orogen due to a lack of extensive syn- and post-collisional magmatism. Moreover, diverse Precambrian detrital zircon age patterns indicate that the surrounding blocks have distinct evolutionary processes with short-term amalgamation during the Meso- to Neoproterozoic.},

   journal = {Precambrian Research},
   volume = {339},
   abstract = {The peripheral or exterior subduction is known to drive the breakup of Rodinia; however, the geodynamic driving mechanism remains controversial, which may result from the slab retreat or the slab avalanche-induced superplume impingement. We report here new constraints on the Neoproterozoic tectonic process whether the northern Tarim Craton at the NW margin of Rodinia was subduction- or mantle plume-dominated that further sheds light on how the peripheral subduction drove the Rodinia breakup. A tectonic transition from the Cryogenian arc and backarc rift to the Ediacaran passive margin characterized northern Tarim, as indicated by the distinct detrital zircon geochronological, geochemical, and structural-sedimentary features between the Ediacaran and Cryogenian sequences. This rejects the mantle plume-dominated evolution, but supports a Neoproterozoic evolving subduction process at the northern Tarim margin, where an advancing subduction (830-780 Ma) evolved into a retreating subduction (< 780 Ma) in response to the retreat of the subducting Pan-Rodinia oceanic slab. The retreat-induced backarc rifting resulted in the opening of the northern Tarim rift between 760 and 740 Ma and the Cryogenian to Ediacaran tectonic transition. The peripheral subduction along the northern Tarim margin had thus caused no rifting before 780 Ma, which was also impossible to induce the > 780 Ma rifting events in the supercontinent interior. These findings imply a composite peripheral subduction-driving mechanism for the Rodinia breakup. The slab retreat probably occurred as the dominant breakup driving force at the supercontinent margins, with less impact to the supercontinent interior; however, another geodynamic driver such as the deep subduction-induced plume impingement may account for the interior rifting and breakup. In addition, a zircon U-Pb age of 636 +/- 2 Ma obtained from tufflava constrains the Tereeken diamictite to correlate with the Marinoan glaciation that further indicates a rapid and globally synchronous termination of the Neoproterozoic "Snowball Earth".},

   abstract = {In this study, we conducted sandstone petrography analyses and determined detrital zircon U-Pb ages and Hf isotopes for sandstones collected at different stratigraphic levels of the lowest strata of the Laiyang Group. All results nearly point to an evolutionary trend for the source regions of the strata. The detrital zircon U-Pb results reveal multiple age groups at 140-123 Ma, 810-700 Ma, and 2,500-1,750 Ma, but variable age proportions for two sandstones (19LY-01Z and -05Z) collected at lowermost and middle levels of strata, respectively, but only one unimodal age mode at ca. 1,850 Ma for the uppermost sandstone 19LY-09Z. Provenance analysis illustrates that the lower strata likely include two source regions, including the Jiaobei Terrane and the Sulu orogen, whereas the upper strata appeared to have one dominant source region (i.e., Jiaobei Terrane). Framework modes of sandstones display that lower samples contain more metamorphic lithic fragments, which corresponds to the recycled orogenic field in the Q-F-L diagram, while middle-upper samples are enriched in feldspars but deficient in lithics and plot in the basement uplift field of the Q-F-L diagram. This compositional variation reflects an evolution of the source regions from the Sulu Orogen to the Jiaobei Terrane, completely consistent with the observation of an increase in the amount of detrital zircons sourced from the Jiaobei Terrane, but decreasing detrital zircons from the Sulu Orogen in an upward order. This shift in the provenance of sediments reflects two tectonic events including exhumation of the Sulu Orogen to the surface before sedimentation of the Laiyang Group, and a rapid uplift of the Jiaobei Terrane after ca. 125 Ma following removal of lithospheric mantle.},

These data provide information on possible source terrains and suggest that Precambrian basement is widespread in the Tianshan and may, at least in part, represent continental fragments rifted off the Tarim craton during the early history of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt Distinct differences in the Precambrian zircon age distribution between the North and Middle Tianshan of Kyrgyzstan support earlier ideas that these two terranes had different crustal histories prior to their amalgamation in the early Palaeozoic. We envisage an archipelago-type scenario for the Palaeo-Asian Ocean south of the Siberian craton in the late Neoproterozoic to early Palaeozoic in which numerous island arcs and Precambrian crustal fragments derived from Tarim drifted northwards (in present coordinates) and were amalgamated and tectonically stacked together during several ocean closure and accretion collision events. This is surprisingly similar to what has been envisaged for the evolution of Indonesia where Mesozoic rifting of fragments from the Australian margin was followed by Cretaceous collisions and Cenozoic collision of Australia with the SE Asian margin. In both Central Asia and Indonesia continental crust has arrived in the region in multiple episodes and has been fragmented and juxtaposed by subduction-related processes.

   abstract = {The Central Asian Orogenic Belt contains many Precambrian crustal fragments whose origin is unknown, and previous speculations suggested these to be derived from either Siberia, Tarim or northern Gondwana. We present an age pattern for detrital and xenocrystic zircons from Neoproterozoic to Palaeozoic arc and microcontinental terranes in Mongolia and compare this with patterns for Precambrian rocks in southern Siberia, the North China craton, the Tarim craton and northeastern Gondwana in order to define the most likely source region for the Mongolian zircons. Our data were obtained by SHRIMP II, LA-ICP-MS and single zircon evaporation and predominantly represent arc-related low-grade volcanic rocks and clastic sediments but also accretionary wedges and ophiolitic environments. The Mongolian pattern is dominated by zircons in the age range ca. 350-600 and 700-1020 Ma as well as minor peaks between ca. 1240 and 2570 Ma. The youngest group reflects cannibalistic reworking of the Palaeozoic arc terranes, whereas the Neoproterozoic to late Mesoproterozoic peak reflects both reworking of the arc terranes as well as Neoproterozoic rifting and a Grenville-age crust-formation event. The 700-1020 Ma peak does not exist in the age spectra of the Siberian and North China cratons and thus effectively rules out these basement blocks as potential source areas for the Mongolian zircons. The best agreement is with the Tarim craton where a major Grenville-age orogenic event and early Neoproterozoic rifting have been identified. The age spectra also do not entirely exclude northeastern Gondwana as a source for the Mongolian zircons, but here the Neoproterozoic age peak is related to the Pan-African orogeny, and a minor Grenville-age peak may reflect a controversial orogenic event in NW India. Our Mongolian detrital and xenocrystic age spectrum suggests that the Tarim craton was the main source, and we favour a tectonic scenario similar to the present southwestern Pacific where fragments of Australia are rifted off and become incorporated into the Indonesian arc and microcontinent amalgamation that will evolve into a future orogenic belt.

The forearc depositional setting is considered to have been dominated by an emergent andesitic volcanic massif, which shows a transition to a fluvialdominated volcanic plain, and then to an offshore marine environment. The youngest laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry U-Pb detrital zircon ages obtained from the three packages define a coherent group (n = 396; MSWD = 1.8) suggesting a maximum depositional age of 169.5 + 0.3 Ma. The dominance of large euhedral and concentrically zoned zircons reflects a common volcanic provenance. Hf isotope data (epsilon(Hf)(t) = 0 to - 11) on the youngest representative zircon grains imply derivation of magmas from dominantly recycled crustal sources. The detrital zircon age signatures and Hf isotope data show no indication of magmatic interaction with adjacent late Palaeozoic and Early to Middle Jurassic sedimentary rocks, or Middle Jurassic to Early Cretaceous magmatic rocks of Hong Kong. On the basis of the structural, zircon age and isotope data, the Tuen Mun Formation is interpreted to be an allochthonous block, emplaced in the Hong Kong region during the late Middle Jurassic.},

   abstract = {The plate kinematic history of the South China Sea opening is key to reconstructing how the Mesozoic configuration of Panthalassa and Tethyan subduction systems evolved into today's complex Southeast Asian tectonic collage. The South China Sea is currently flanked by the Palawan Continental Terrane in the south and South China in the north and the two blocks have long been assumed to be conjugate margins. However, the paleogeographic history of the Palawan Continental Terrane remains an issue of uncertainty and controversy, especially regarding the questions of where and when it was separated from South China. Here we employ detrital zircon U-Pb geochronology and heavy mineral analysis on Cretaceous and Eocene strata from the northern South China Sea and Palawan to constrain the Late Mesozoic-Early Cenozoic provenance and paleogeographic evolution of the region testing possible connection between the Palawan Continental Terrane and the northern South China Sea margin. In addition to a revision of the regional stratigraphic framework using the youngest zircon U-Pb ages, these analyses show that while the Upper Cretaceous strata from the Palawan Continental Terrane are characterized by a dominance of zircon with crystallization ages clustering around the Cretaceous, the Eocene strata feature a large range of zircon ages and a new mineral group of rutile, anatase, and monazite. On the one hand, this change of sediment compositions seems to exclude the possibility of a latest Cretaceous drift of the Palawan Continental Terrane in response to the Proto-South China Sea opening as previously inferred. On the other hand, the zircon age signatures of the Cretaceous-Eocene strata from the Palawan Continental Terrane are largely comparable to those of contemporary samples from the northeastern South China Sea region, suggesting a possible conjugate relationship between the Palawan Continental Terrane and the eastern Pearl River Mouth Basin. Thus, the Palawan Continental Terrane is interpreted to have been attached to the South China margin from the Cretaceous until the Oligocene oceanization of the South China Sea. In our preferred paleogeographic scenario, the sediment provenance in the northeastern South China Sea region changed from dominantly nearby Cretaceous continental arcs of the South China margin to more distal southeastern South China in the Eocene.

We use detrital zircon U-Pb geochronology to explore the source-to-sink characteristics of syn-rift sequences in the northern South China Sea. The results reveal significant intrabasinal provenances in addition to the well-perceived terrigenous supply from the north. The Dongsha Uplift is considered to account for the dominance of the Early Cretaceous zircons in the Eocene samples. The Lower Oligocene sediments in the Qiongdongnan Basin could have been sourced from Hainan Island and local uplifts, but their distinction cannot be confirmed by the U-Pb age spectra. Contemporary sediments in the northern Pearl River Mouth Basin were most likely transported from southeastern South China with well-rounded zircon grains showing U-Pb age similarity to those from the northeastern tributaries of the Pearl River. By contrast, intrabasinal sources from the west and east are suggested to have contributed the infill of the southern part of the Pearl River Mouth Basin based on generally euhedral zircon shapes. These sedimentary source patterns appear to change very little in the Oligocene northern South China Sea. However, the newly detected Neoproterozoic zircons in the Upper Oligocene sediments from borehole L21 tend to indicate a southern source. The episodic and diachronic nature of rifting and erosion processes in the early South China Sea is the cause of complex patterns in the Paleogene provenance history.},

Drastic provenance transformation on the SCS sedimentary patterns has been first discovered that source of Central Vietnam was replaced by Pearl River networks. Rapidly changing local provenances of different source rocks were discerned during Eocene and early Oligocene times. Briefly, the Pearl River drainage system gradually evolved by regional tectonic processes into the present scale and exerted its influence on the northern SCS basins. During early Oligocene, only limited areas received sediments from Pearl River tributaries on the South China continent, while the majority of the southern areas were controlled by the Central Vietnam provenance before the late Oligocene. After the early Miocene, significant amounts of sediment from the inner South China continent were transported into northern SCS basins by the western Pearl River tributaries. Meanwhile, an impressive "Kontum-Ying-Qiong" river system (K-Y-Q) had delivered huge amounts of sediments from Central Vietnam mafic-to-ultramafic source rocks to the regions farther east since the early Oligocene or even Eocene. This remarkable K-Y-Q traversing the whole Qiongdongnan Basin was gradually replaced by a transport system from the adjacent Hainan Island, in modern-day China, providing acidic detritus after the early Miocene. Admittedly, Tethyan subduction beneath Sundaland makes the paleo-reconstruction work tough and elusive. However, we laid the emphasis on possible basin depositions to unravel the mystery and our discovery of the impressive conduit from Central Vietnam of the Indochina Block, transferring abundant basic sediments derived from the Indosinian event, surely would be of remarkable significance on research of (1) paleo-geographical evolution by Tethys-southern Eurasia Plate collisional effects and (2) tectonic reconstruction for the entire southeastern margin of the Eurasian continent.},

   abstract = {The pre-Oligocene sediment succession including shipboard lithological Units II (77.65-275.54 mbsf) and III (275.54-300 mbsf) from International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Hole U1435A in the northern South China Sea is characterized by greenish to dark gray sandstone and siltstone of coastal marine facies with age previously undetermined due to a lack of age-diagnostic fossils. Detrital zircon U-Pb ages (9 samples) and thin sections (76 samples) from these two units, together with geochemical elements (197 samples) from Units I to III were analyzed to distinguish provenance, tectonic setting, and depositional age and environment. Petrographic study reveals that most samples are fine sandstones, mainly composed of subangular quartz (70-80%) and alkaline feldspar (10-15%; mostly K-feldspar), indicating a near proximal provenance. Discrimination diagrams, element ratios and chondrite-normalized rare earth element patterns suggest a relatively stable source of felsic rocks. Detrital zircon U-Pb dating results reveal a dominance of Mesozoic ages with a pronounced Early Cretaceous peak at similar to 110 Ma. Fourteen zircon grains from 7 samples yield much younger ages between similar to 65 and 38 Ma, indicating middle to late Eocene deposition, broadly corresponding to the lacustrine-shallow neritic Enping-Wenchang Formations of the Pearl River Mouth Basin. Comparison among various elemental proxies from the Eocene sediments in Hole U1435A and in offshore industrial wells confirms a continental island arc setting in the Cretaceous when the zircons were produced. In the middle and late Eocene, these Cretaceous igneous rocks were likely the source of the sediment deposited in a coastal marine environment. The relatively minor variations in elemental distribution and the concentration of Paleogene zircons (similar to 50-38 Ma) further imply a consistent supply of weathered material from this magmatic landmass during an active rifting period before the opening of the South China Sea.},

The Upper Triassic depocenter was located at the front of the Longmen Shan belt, and sediments in the western, southern and eastern Sichuan basin shared the southern North China block (NCB) and Qinling belt with the eastern Songpan-Ganzi terrane of Middle-Upper Triassic via the Longmen Shan belt, whereas the northern part of the basin was fed by dominant Smith Qinling belt (SQB) and northern Yangtze block and possibly subordinate southern NCB. Also, the youngest population in the northern Sichuan basin has a slightly younger age peak (similar to 235 Ma) than those (similar to 270 Ma) in other parts of the basin. During the Early Jurassic, the depocenter was still at the front of the Longmen Shan belt but only northern regions (e.g., SQB and northern Yangtze block) fed the basin. The northern Sichuan basin received less sediments from the southern NCB and more from the SQB and northern Yangtze block during the Early Jurassic than during the Late Triassic. The middle Mesoproterozoic detrital zircons, which likely originated from the North Qinling belt and northern Yangtze block where rocks with these zircons may be unexposed, occur more widely in the Lower Jurassic than in the Upper Triassic. These facts suggest that from the Late Triassic to Early Jurassic, it was increasingly difficult for sediments to transport from the NCB into the northern Sichuan basin and the provenance transferred progressively from the southern NCB to both the SQB and northern Yangtze block, implying the continuous South China block-NCB collision during that time.

   abstract = {The affinity and tectonic setting of the Qinfang basin have long been an enigma. Here we conduct detrital zircon U-Pb geochronology and Hf isotope analysis of Lower-Middle Devonian to Middle Jurassic samples from the basin. Along with published age data and paleontology from the basin and its east and west sides, this study constrains the sediment provenance and tectonic setting of the basin. Sandstones of Devonian-Jurassic exhibit an age distribution with major age groups at 2700-2300 Ma (absence for Jurassic), 1200-800 Ma, 600-400 Ma, and 334-246 Ma (for Jurassic alone). Zircons (peak-2500 Ma) were sourced from the Yangtze block, while-1200-800 Ma grains may originate from the Yunkai massif and Jiangnan orogen.-600-400 Ma zircons came from Yunkai massif and/or Cambrian to Silurian sediments in the basin. Carboniferous-Early Triassic (334-246 Ma) zircons were probably supplied by an older sequence in the Great Youjiang basin and the Darongshan-Shiwandashan igneous rocks. The Qinfang basin and its two sides are considered to share a common East Gondwana source in Silurian. The similarity in age spectra between Silurian-Devonian samples in the basin and Ailaoshan belt suggests that the basin is a remnant of the Paleo-Tethyan (Ailaoshan) Ocean. However, the distinct age distribution between the basin and Indochina block shows that the basin is not a part of the Indochina block. By Middle Jurassic following the final closure of the Ailaoshan Ocean in the Late Triassic, the adjacent western area may be still tectonically active, thereby feeding the basin with detritus of Early Permian.},

   abstract = {The Indus River, originating from Manasarovar Lake in Tibet, runs along the Indus Tsangpo suture zone in Ladakh which separates the Tethyan Himalaya in the south from the Karakoram zone to the north. Due to the barriers created by the Pir-Panjal ranges and the High Himalaya, Ladakh is located in a rain shadow zone of the Indian summer monsoon (ISM) making it a high-altitude desert. Occasional catastrophic hydrological events are known to endanger lives and properties of people residing there. Evidence of such events in the recent geologic past that are larger in magnitude than modern occurrences is preserved along the channels. Detailed investigation of these archives is imperative to expand our knowledge of extreme floods that rarely occur on the human timescale. Understanding the frequency, distribution, and forcing mechanisms of past extreme floods of this region is crucial to examine whether the causal agents are regional, global, or both on long timescales. We studied the Holocene extreme flood history of the Upper Indus catchment in Ladakh using slackwater deposits (SWDs) preserved along the Indus and Zanskar Rivers. SWDs here are composed of stacks of sand-silt couplets deposited rapidly during large flooding events in areas where a sharp reduction of flow velocity is caused by local geomorphic conditions. Each couplet represents a flood, the age of which is constrained using optically stimulated luminescence for sand and accelerator mass spectrometry and liquid scintillation counter C-14 for charcoal specks from hearths. The study suggests occurrence of large floods during phases of strengthened ISM when the monsoon penetrated into arid Ladakh. Comparison with flood records of rivers draining other regions of the Himalaya and those influenced by the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) indicates asynchronicity with the Western Himalaya that confirms the existing anti-phase relationship of the ISM-EASM that occurred in the Holocene. Detrital zircon provenance analysis indicates that sediment transportation along the Zanskar River is more efficient than the main Indus channel during extreme floods. Post-Last Glacial Maximum human migration, during warm and wet climatic conditions, into the arid upper Indus catchment is revealed from hearths found within the SWDs.},

The late Palaeoproterozoic group is predominant in all of the five samples, and yielded remarkable age peaks at c. 1.85 Ga. These zircons have epsilon(Hf)(t) values between -22.5 and +3.6, suggesting derivation from reworked Archaean crust and minor juvenile crustal additions in the late Palaeoproterozoic. These characteristics differ from those of the Yangtze Block but correlate well with those of samples from the eastern Cathaysia Block. Palaeocurrent analysis of the Early Mesozoic sandstones shows predominant west- and NW-directed palaeoflows, supporting derivation of the sediments from the Cathaysia Block. The remarkable similarities in provenance signatures and spatial changes of lithofacies of the TriassicJurassic around the South China Craton delineate an east-west-trending sedimentary zone extending from Korea to West China. Accumulation of these sediments was probably related to the development of an active continental margin produced by westward subduction of the Palaeo-Pacific Plate. A c. 2000 km long westerly draining transcontinental palaeoriver probably had existed in the Early Mesozoic and fed the basins in Korea, South China and West China.},

This paper presents the results of detrital zircon LA-ICPMS U-Pb ages for Cretaceous sediments from the Yichang area of the Jianghan Basin, central China. The results provide new information on the provenance of these sediments and the detailed exhumation process of the Huangling Dome. Zircons with different age populations have been derived from the strata of the Huangling Dome. The Liantuo, Gucheng and Nantuo formations and the Kongling complex were exhumed, leading to deposition of the early Cretaceous Wulong Formation, which provides the sources of zircons with age peaks at 3.1-3.0, 2.5 and 1.8 Ga. Exhumation of the Huangling granitoid and contemporary volcanics provided the source of the late Cretaceous Luojingtan Formation, which contains zircons with age peaks at 1.1-0.95 and 0.83-0.74 Ga. The Qinling-Dabie orogeny supplied zircons with an age cluster of 0.27 to 0.18 Ga. These results indicate the timing of initial exhumation for the Huangling granite. They also show how overlying strata was first uplifted and eroded, followed by exposure of underlying strata at the surface during continued exhumation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Two rapid cooling events at ca. 840-800 and similar to 206-151 to 43 Ma existed in the Huangling massif and the major exhumation period of the Qinling-Dabie Orogen at 221-195 Ma. The important tectonothermal event at 221-195 Ma of the Qinling-Dabie Orogen was characterized by the collision between the south China and the north China block and overprinted the whole Qinling-Dabie Orogen and the north Yangtze block. Together with the published geochronology, our data constrain the paleogeography of eastern China: (i) The Upper Triassic-Lower Jurassic strata have their sources in the Qinling-Dabie Orogen and the Cathaysia and Yangtze basement of the South China Block. (ii) In the Middle Jurassic, the Sichuan, Jianghan, Hengyang, and Mayang basins formed a large composite basin with identical provenance from the Qinling-Dabie Orogen and the Cathaysia. (iii) Since the Late Cretaceous, the Jiangnan Orogen and a mountain belt along the Pacific coast constituted important topographic boundaries in southern China.

   abstract = {The Cathaysia Block in South China Block (SCB) is famous for its polyphase granitic magmatism and world-class mineralization, especially W, Sn and REE. Although isotopic data suggest that widespread igneous rocks were derived from Precambrian basement, outcrops of the basement rocks are rare in the Cathaysia Block. Therefore, the distribution of the Archean-Paleoproterozoic basement beneath Cathaysia Block is still unclear.
The northeastern-striking Pingtan-Dongshan metamorphic belt (PDMB) is located along the coastal region of southeastern China, and consists mainly of voluminous granites and volcanic rocks with minor metasedimentary rocks. These metasedimentary rocks were intruded or captured by 160-143 Ma granites. U-Pb dating of detrital and metamorphic zircons from seven metasedimentary rocks indicates that their protoliths were deposited between 183 Ma and 160 Ma, rather than pre-Devonian as previously proposed. Dating of metamorphic zircons suggests that the most important metamorphism took place at ca 97 Ma, consistent with emplacement of A-type granites and mafic magmatism in the coastal region, and implying an extensional setting.
Age spectra of detrital zircons in samples from the middle and southern PDMB exhibit a bimodal distribution with abundant Late Paleoproterozoic and Early Mesozoic zircons. In contrast, age spectra of detrital zircons from the northern PDMB display pronounced Neoproterozoic and Early Paleozoic age peaks as well as Late Paleoproterozoic and Early Mesozoic ones, suggesting a different provenance. The comparisons of age and Hf-isotope with the exposed rocks of the SCB suggest that the terrigenous material in these sediments was sourced from the Wuyi terrane, in the eastern Cathaysia Block.
The age spectra of detrital zircons from Early Paleozoic to Late Mesozoic sedimentary rocks in the SE SCB show that late Paleoproterozoic (1.9-1.8 Ga) detritus increases markedly in Middle Permian to Early Cretaceous sedimentary rocks. Comparison with zircon U-Pb-Hf isotopic data from exposed Paleoproterozoic rocks suggests that a Paleoproterozoic basement existed extensively beneath the eastern Cathaysia Block. It has been uplifted and eroded since Middle Permian time, and then covered by Late Cretaceous volcanic rocks. The uplift of the Paleoproterozoic basement was probably caused by the Late Paleozoic orogeny in the eastern Cathaysia Block. (C)2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The Paleo-Mesoproterozoic and Cambrian zircons have positive epsilon(Hf)(t) values, suggesting that the source was mainly locally derived from the CAOB, whereas a lesser amount of Archean zircons with positive epsilon(Hf)(t) values, indicating that source from the North China Craton (NCC). The Phanerozoic zircons have both positive and negative epsilon(Hf)(t) values indicates that material from bidirectional provenances in the CAOB and the NCC. However, Late Permian Kaishantun Formation in eastern Jilin Province contain a single group of Phanerozoic zircons with positive epsilon(Hf)(t) values, distinct from known igneous zircons in the NCC, suggesting a local source. These observations, along with the results of previous studies on Middle-Late Permian igneous rocks in Jilin Province, indicate that the eastern segment of the Paleo-Asian Ocean underwent the initial closure in central Jilin Province during the Middle Permian and the final closure in eastern Jilin Province in the Late Permian-Early Triassic. The detrital zircon geochronological data clearly record two stages of tectonic evolution and the scissor-like closure model of the Paleo-Asian Ocean in the eastern segment of the CAOB.},

   abstract = {In order to unravel the Mesozoic sedimentation in response to multistage deformation of the western Ordos fold-thrust belt, combined zircon U-Pb and fission track analyses of single zircon grain are conducted for seven sandstone samples in the Helanshan area. Zircon FT ages are calculated using absolute uranium concentration determined by LA-ICP-MS during the procedure of zircon U-Pb dating. The newly-obtained zircon FT data show age features that are comparable with the previous zircon FT ages obtained by conventional FT methods (by which uranium contents are determined through an external detector to map induced fission tracks). The newly obtained zircon FT ages have four subordinate FT age peaks (i.e., 225 Ma, 165 Ma, 125 Ma and 80 Ma) which are well matched with the regional geodynamic events occurred in the Late Triassic, Late Jurassic, Late Cretaceous and Early Cenozoic, respectively; and the zircon U-Pb ages have two main peaks at the Paleoproterozoic and the Late Paleozoic. The zircon U-Pb ages, integrating with the FT ages and available paleocurrents, suggest that the Paleoproterozoic basement rocks and Late Paleozoic plutonic rocks of the Alxa Block are the source rocks for the Triassic sandstones, and the Jurassic sandstones are associated with a multi-cycling sedimentation. The Jurassic sandstones contain recycled zircons that firstly deposited in the Triassic strata and subsequently exhumed during the Late Triassic-Early Jurassic.},

   abstract = {The Solonker and Shalazhashan belts are hotly debated tectonic units of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB), because they may either represent a Permian or Triassic suture zone of the CAOB, or a rifting zone overprinted on an Early Palaeozoic orogen. Provenance analysis of the Upper Palaeozoic sandstones in these belts may provide useful constraints on this issue. This study collected six sandstone samples from three study areas: the Mandula area of the Solonker Belt, the Quagan Qulu area of the Shalazhashan Belt but close to the Alxa block, and the Enger Us area of the Shalazhashan Belt, for framework petrography, zircon morphology, U-Pb and Lu-Hf isotopic analyses. Framework petrography reveals that the Mandula and Enger Us area samples contain high proportions of volcanic fragments, whereas the samples from the Quagan Qulu area include not only volcanic fragments but also significant amounts of biotite and muscovite. The detrital zircons of the Mandula area and the Enger Us area yield two main age groups: (i) 260-330 Ma, with dominant epsilon(Hf)(t) values of -5 to +12; and (ii) 420-550 Ma, with dominant epsilon(Hf)(t) values of -9 to +9, suggesting that Early Palaeozoic arc-related magmatic rocks and Late Palaeozoic syn-depositional volcanic rocks are the main source rocks. The detrital zircons of the Quagan Qulu area have one main age group of 420-500 Ma and some grains of 0.9-1.1 Ga, 1.4-1.5 Ga, 1.8-1.9 Ga and similar to 2.5 Ga, which derive from the northern margin of the Alxa block. The lithological and fossil assemblages of the Upper Palaeozoic sandstones suggest shallow-marine to deep-water depositional environments and a northward-deepening transition. Based on the zircon spectra, sedimentary environment analysis and previous studies, we argue that the Solonker Belt and the Shalazhashan Belt of the CAOB are in extensional basins of a fore-arc or rifting setting.},

   abstract = {The Qinling Complex lies in the Qinling orogenic belt of Central China and holds the key to understanding the evolution of this feature. The Qinling Complex comprises a basement complex composed of amphibolite and ecologite, overlain by a supra-crustal succession that has been metamorphosed to the upper greenschist facies at approximately 516-509 Ma. The protoliths of the meta-sedimentary rocks are graywackes, which are divided into lower, middle and upper units. Detrital zircons from nine samples of the supra-crustal succession have ages ranging from 1182 to 1158 Ma for the lower unit, 957 to 955 Ma for the middle unit and 917 to 840 Ma for the upper unit. The lower unit is intruded by a ca. 960 Ma pluton. The bulk compositions of these mew-sedimentary rocks and their detrital zircon ages clearly indicate derivation from Meso- and Neo-proterozoic granites. Thus, we suggest that the sedimentary succession was derived from an arc-related tectonic setting and that none of the detritus was sourced from the southern margin of the North China Block or from the northern and western margins of the South China Block. We conclude that the North Qinling Belt was an independent micro-continental block during the Meso- to Neo-proterozoic.},

   abstract = {The tectonic attribute and evolution of the Bogda Mountain are crucial to understand the Palaeozoic development of the Tian Shan and Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB). In this work, we combined sedimentological and geophysical methods such as field section measurements, core analyses, well logs and seismic sections interpretation to study the sedimentary evolution from the Middle Permian to Early Triassic. In addition, provenance analysis was performed for the sediments from both flanks of the Bogda Mountain. This set of data allows to improve the constraint on the tectonic attribute and evolution in this area. The facies studies indicate abrupt changes in depositional environments from the lacustrine-alluvial fan to fan delta during the Middle to Late Permian. The subsidence centers shifted from the Paleo-Bogda Mountain to present Bogda piedmonts. Based on detrital zircon U-Pb geochronology, the North Tian Shan (NTS) Early-Middle Permian post-collisional plutons are identified as the main provenances of the Middle Permian deposits from both flanks. The Upper Permian sample shows a strongly concentrated unimodal age peak of similar to 305-320 Ma, indicating a single source from the NTS and Bogda Mountain. The Lower Triassic samples in the Chaiwopu Depression (CWD) in the south flank of the Bogda Mountain show obvious sources from the Central Tian Shan (CTS) but these are absent in all samples from the north flank of Bogda Mountain. Meanwhile, the Early Permian ages of similar to 280-295 Ma which correspond to the bimodal volcanism in the Bogda Mountain occur in both flanks of this mountain. According to the comprehensive geological evidence, the deposition of the Lower Permian-Middle Permian strata probably occurred in a rift extension and expansion setting. A tectonic inversion happened at the beginning of the Late Permian, which resulted in initial uplift of the Bogda Mountain. The uplift also occurred in the NTS and CTS in the Late Permian. This tectonic inversion happened for the whole Junggar Basin and was an important intracontinental tectonic movement, which might result from the consolidation of the Pangea supercontinent.},

This study presents new zircon U-Pb ages and petrographic observations of the migmatitic pelitic gneisses and mylonitized granite intrusions from the Dai Loc Complex in order to constrain the Early Paleozoic thermal history of the eastern Indochina Block. The identification of metamorphic zircon with sillimanite inclusions, euhedral cordierite, and garnet in the migmatitic pelitic gneisses indicates high temperature metamorphic conditions at ca. 430-440 Ma. The metamorphism was followed by an isobaric cooling stage defined by the replacing of cordierite by kyanite-staurolite-quartz symplectite. The Dai Loc granite likely intruded the metapelites at ca. 430 Ma and was subsequently mylonitized. The thermal event in the Dai Loc Complex may be correlated with Ordovician-Silurian low pressure/high temperature metamorphism caused by subduction related arc magmatism in the Kannack and Ngoc Linh Complexes of the Kontum Massif. However, the frequency distribution of detrital zircon ages suggests the metasedimentary rocks from Dai Loc Complex have a unique provenance that was distinct from those of the neighboring A Vuong Formation and South China Block.},

Based predominantly on trace-elemental compositions, the sedimentary protolith is most likely a poorly sorted and immature greywacke, such as those formed in island arc or active continental margin settings. The island arc-related chemical signature coupled with zircon U-Pb age data supports a Neoproterozoic (> 760 Ma) sedimentation age, whereas Nd-Hf isotope data of precursor sediments are linked to a relatively immature Tonian (similar to 940-780 Ma) continental arc involving Paleoproterozoic crustal basement. The limited provenance information and metamorphic history of the Muya block suggests it was exotic to Siberia and originally related to another continent, e.g. - subduction-accretion complexes of South China. The polyphase metasediments experienced high-grade metamorphism in the Tonian during the 764-754 Ma arc accretion to an enigmatic continental block and then in the Ediacaran during the 622-608 Ma accretion of the Baikal-Muya belt to the arc situated at the southern Siberia margin. Metamorphic overprinting during the introduction of supracrustal rocks to deeper-crustal levels led to protracted re crystallization of primary igneous zircon population and growth of new granulite-facies grains that did not involve notable juvenile input. Tonian sedimentary provenance and two metamorphic events suggest a protracted evolution for the Baikal-Muya belt associated with the formation of precursor complexes beyond the southern margin of Siberia and their later accretion to Late Cryogenian - Ediacarian arc complexes of the southern Siberian, which proceeded only after the opening of the Paleoasian Ocean (670-630 Ma).},

   abstract = {Sedimentological and detrital zircon provenance study of the Lower Palaeozoic Zuunnuruu, Tsetseg and Sagsai sedimentary formations was carried out in the eastern part of the Floyd Zone in western Mongolia. Sedimentological analysis has revealed two distinct and consecutive types of sedimentary environments. The Lower Ordovician-earliest Silurian sediments had dominantly volcano-sedimentary character, interpreted as reflecting deposition in a proximal part of a Pacific-type accretionary wedge. The upper, mainly Devonian part of the profile has generally siliciclastic flysch-like nature and indicates platform-type depositional setting related to the synextensional thinning of the accretionary wedge-system. Detrital zircon age populations of all the three studied formations uniformly show a dominant Neoproterozoic-Ordovician age group at ca. 560-460 Ma, a broad Neo- to Mesoproterozoic peak at ca. 1050-720 Ma, several minor Meso- to Palaeoproterozoic age clusters at ca. 1.4, 1.9 and 2.4 Ga and ca. 400-360 Ma peaks in the youngest Devonian formation. The early Palaeozoic part of the age spectra is interpreted as detritus mainly derived from the magmatic rocks of the Cambrian-Ordovician Ikh-Mongol Arc System within the nearby Lake Zone and the youngest ages from the neighbouring Devonian granites. The other sources were identified as more distal Tonian magmatic-arc complexes, Rodinia break-up-related volcanic rocks and basement of the Precambrian Zavkhan and Baidrag continental blocks even further east. The maximum sedimentary ages, determined by the youngest detrital zircons, shift the end of deposition of the Sagsai Formation at least to the latest Devonian. Nearly identical detrital zircon age spectra from Lower Palaeozoic sequences of the Hovd Zone and other parts of the Altai belt support an existence of a single giant accretionary complex developed along the entire outer margin of the Ikh-Mongol Arc System. The change in the sedimentary style suggests the latest Ordovician-earliest Silurian termination of magmatic-arc activity in the western Lake Zone, marking the onset of late Silurian-Devonian crustal extensional period in the Altai accretionary system.

   abstract = {The origin and tectonic affinity of the Alxa Block in NW China is currently debatable. This study reports new stratigraphically-constrained LA-ICP-MS zircon U-Pb data from Precambrian rocks exposed in the westernmost part of the Alxa Block, to constrain their ages and provenance. Ages obtained for a granitic gneiss from the Longshoushan Group are mainly discordant yielding an upper intercept near 1200 Ma and a lower intercept between similar to 350 and similar to 310 Ma, indicating the protolith for the granitic gneiss intruded during the Mesoproterozoic, and the gneissic fabric formed in late Paleozoic associated with the accretion of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt. Detrital zircons of a meta-sandstone from Pre-Sinian strata yielded predominant Mesoproterozoic ages with bimodal peaks at similar to 1166 Ma and similar to 1375 Ma. These ages are interpreted as tectonic events associated with the long-lived accretion and collision processes coeval with the amalgamation of the Rodinia supercontinent. The youngest concordant zircon age of 968 +/- 70 Ma constrains its maximum depositional age to the Stenian-Tonian boundary. Two metasedimentary rocks from the Sinian strata share similar age patterns, yielding an earliest Paleoproterozoic peak at similar to 2469-2460 Ma, and two Tonian peaks at similar to 992-978 Ma and similar to 826-807 Ma. The youngest detrital zircon ages constrain their maximum depositional age to be latest Neoproterozoic. The detrital age patterns, as well as zircon morphology, indicate that the protoliths for these metasedimentary rocks were probably deposited in collision-related foreland basins. Our new data combined with published data indicate that the Alxa Block is not a uniform early Precambrian craton like the North China Craton, but a Precambrian composite ribbon continent which originally detached from a main cratonic accretionary and collisional margin. The Alxa Block, like the South China Craton, underwent a multi-stage tectono-thermal evolution related to the assembly of Rodinia and Gondwana supercontinents during global plate margin reorganization. Current data support a close affinity of the Alxa Block to the SCC during the Precambrian. During the Paleozoic, the Alxa ribbon continent behaved as a backbone to the Paleo-Asian Ocean to the north, on which early Paleozoic-Permian magmatic arcs were built forming the southernmost segment of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt.},

   abstract = {The origin and tectonic settings of metasedimentary sequences in the Central Asian Orogenic Belt have been a matter of debate regarding their contributions with some proposals of being microcontinents or accreted material, largely due to a lack of high resolution geochronological data. This paper reports detrital zircon U-Pb age and Hf isotopic data for the previously mapped Precambrian metasedimentary rocks from the Beishan orogenic collage, southern Altaids. Our data show that Precambrian ages dominate all the analyzed samples, but two samples yield Paleozoic zircons which suggest that they were not deposited in the Precambrian. The late Paleoproterozoic-early Mesoproterozoic group (similar to 2000-1300 Ma) is the largest age population among the six samples analyzed. This age population (similar to 2000-1300 Ma) corresponds to the assembly and subsequent break-up of the Columbia supercontinent. Only one sample (11SYS01) yields Neoproterozoic ages (with two peaks at 930 and 785 Ma), which shows a possible affinity with the Tarim Craton. Hence, the age spectra presented here are generally different from that of the Tarim Craton and the metasedimentary rocks from the Central Tienshan. Our data show that the Tarim Craton is not the main source area for the metasedimentary rocks from the Beishan orogenic collage, but instead multiple source areas may have contributed to the Beishan collage. Combining our new results with published data, we favor an allochthonous origin for the metasedimentary sequences which may be associated with major thrust tectonics. Therefore, a long-lived arc accretionary model is proposed for the tectonic evolution of the Beishan orogenic collage. (C) 2013 International Association for Gondwana Research.

   abstract = {The sources of ancient zircons and the tectonic attributions and origins of metamorphic complexes in Phanerozoic accretionary orogens have long been difficult issues. Situated between the Tianshan and Inner Mongolia orogens, the Beishan orogenic collage (BOC) plays a pivotal role in understanding the accretionary processes of the southern Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB), particularly the extensive metamorphic and high-strained complexes on the southern margin. Despite their importance in understanding the basic architecture of the southern CAOB, little consensus has been reached on their ages and origins. Our new structural, LA-ICP-MS zircon U-Pb and Hf isotopic data from the Baidunzi, Shibandun, Qtaowan and Wutongjing metamorphic complexes resolve current controversial relations. The metamorphic complexes have varied lithologies and structures. Detrital zircons from five para-metamorphic rocks yield predominantly Phanerozoic ages with single major peaks at ca. 276 Ma, 286 Ma, 427 Ma, 428 Ma and 461 Ma. Two orthogneisses have weighted mean ages of 294 +/- 2 Ma and 304 +/- 2 Ma with no Precambrian inherited zircons. Most Phanerozoic zircons show positive epsilon-Hf-(t) values indicating significant crustal growth in the Ordovician, Silurian and Permian. The imbricated fold-thrust deformation style combined with diagnostic zircon U-Pb-Hf isotopic data demonstrate that the metamorphic rocks developed in a subduction-accretion setting on an arc or active continental margin. This setting and conclusion are supported by the nearby occurrence of Ordovician-Silurian adaldtes, Nb-rich basalts, Carboniferous-Permian ophiolitic melanges, and trench-type turbidites. Current data do not support the presence of a widespread Precambrian basement in the evolution of the BOC; the accretionary processes may have continued to the early Permian in this part of the CAOB. These relationships have meaningful implications for the interpretation of the tectonic attributions and origins of other metamorphic complexes in Central Asia and other ancient accretion-dominated orogens.

   abstract = {The timing of final subduction and closure of the Paleo-Asian Ocean (PAO) is controversial. Located in a key position within the southern Central Asian Orogenic Belt, the Alxa Tectonic Belt (ATB) provides a crucial window to evaluate the final subduction processes of the PAO. This study presents field and geochronological data for Permian volcano-sedimentary rocks from the southwestern ATB. Field observations revealed a syntectonic unconformity between the Middle and Upper Permian strata. Detrital zircon U-Pb analyses show a major peak at similar to 273Ma and a subordinate peak at similar to 440Ma for the Middle Permian sample. The Upper Permian samples show consistently unimodal age spectra with single peaks at similar to 261 and similar to 263Ma, respectively. The Permian zircons from the analyzed samples yield predominately positive epsilon(Hf)(t) values, indicating major juvenile magmatic processes mixed with limited recycled Precambrian basement. The diagnostic zircon U-Pb-Hf isotopic characteristics and ubiquitous intermediate and felsic volcanic detritus in these rocks indicate rapid sediments accumulation sourced from a proximal magmatic terrane in a suprasubduction zone environment. The Paleozoic zircon U-Pb age peaks from this study are comparable to those for the Permian arc-related sediments along the Solonker Suture Zone, thus linking the Alxa active margin with the northern margin of the North China Craton during Middle-Late Permian times. Our study thus provides key constraints for the final subduction processes of the PAO, documented within the ATB, before the terminal amalgamation of the southern Central Asian Orogenic Belt.},

   abstract = {The Central Asian Orogenic Belt has long been considered the largest Phanerozoic accretionary orogen in the world; it developed through the subduction and final closure of the Paleo-Asian Ocean. However, the architecture and duration of the accretionary orogenesis of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt are still controversial despite decades of investigation. In this study, we present field, compositional, and stratigraphically controlled detrital zircon geochronological data for late Paleozoic sedimentary rocks from the Alxa Tectonic Belt to constrain their provenance, tectonic setting, and the overall tectonic configuration of the southern Central Asian Orogenic Belt. A Devonian sample yields a unimodal age peak (ca. 424 Ma) and broad late Mesoproterozoic ages. A Carboniferous sample has Early Silurian (ca. 438 Ma) and Late Devonian (ca. 382 Ma) peaks along with Neoproterozoic to Archean ages. The Permian samples are dominated by Ordovician-Devonian and Carboniferous-Permian ages. They yield maximum depositional ages ranging from ca. 291 Ma to 248 Ma and contain abundant zircon ages that are close to their depositional ages. These data reveal Ordovician-Silurian and Carboniferous- Permian magmatic flare-ups separated by a Devonian magmatic lull in the southern Central Asian Orogenic Belt. The arc terranes in southern Mongolia, central Beishan, and northern Alxa provided major detritus for the late Paleozoic sediments. An abrupt shift of zircon epsilon(Hf)(t) values at ca. 400 Ma reveals significant late Paleozoic crustal growth and excludes southern Alxa as a source. Oceanic basins prevented detritus from southern Alxa from reaching northern Alxa during Permian-Early Triassic time. A geological and provenance comparison of Permian basins in the southern Central Asian Orogenic Belt reveals the existence of two separate forearcs ascribed to bipolar subduction of the Paleo- Asian Ocean. Combined with recent paleomagnetic data, this leads us to advocate for an archipelago-style accretionary process induced by subduction retreat for the late Paleozoic tectonic evolution of the southern Central Asian Orogenic Belt, which continued into Late Permian-Early Triassic.},

   abstract = {The late Neoproterozoic (similar to 720-541 Ma) tectonic evolution of South China may have included the development of a paleo-ocean basin (the South China Ocean Basin, SCOB) between the Yangtze and Cathaysia blocks. The Niuhe section in the Yongfu area of northern Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, owing to its location on the southeastern margin of the Yangtze Block and its preservation of an alternating succession typical of both Yangtze- and Cathaysia-type deposits, provides an important window to test if this oceanic basin existed during the late Neoproterozoic. Cryogenian-Ediacaran siliciclastics in the northern Guangxi region were deposited in the intracontinental Xiang-Gui Basin. Detrital zircon assemblages from the Cryogenian Lijiapo Formation at Niuhe yield a prominent U-Pb age peak of similar to 774 Ma, with a minor peak of similar to 891 Ma, indicative of provenance from the Yangtze Block to the northwest. In contrast, zircon samples from the Cryogenian Zhengyuanling Formation of the Laoshan area (Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region), which is located closer to the Cathaysia Block than Niuhe, yield a prominent age peak of 959-1112 Ma, consistent with a Cathaysian provenance. Furthermore, three samples of Ediacaran sandstones from Niuhe yield an age peak of similar to 900-1100 Ma, also demonstrating provenance from the southeast (i.e., Cathaysia). The Cathaysian provenance of Ediacaran sandstones on the southeastern margin of the Yangtze Block does not support the scenario of a broad SCOB between the Yangtze and Cathaysia blocks during the Ediacaran, and the Xiang-Gui Basin is best regarded as an immature intracontinental rift (aulacogen). Uplift of the Cathaysian Block through slab retreat on its external (southeastern) margin (i.e., the 'top-down' model of Rodinian breakup) may have been responsible for generation of a massive influx of siliciclastics into the Xiang-Gui Basin during the Ediacaran.},

   abstract = {The Yishu fault zone has an important impact on sedimentary formation, magmatism, and mineralization in Shandong Province of eastern China. Determining the sedimentary source, tectonic setting, and age of the Cretaceous Dasheng Group Malanggou Formation is of great significance for clarifying the relationship between the tectonic evolution and mineralization of the Yishu fault zone. In order to decipher the source characteristics and associated sedimentary setting, elemental geochemistry and detrital zircon U-Pb geochronology of sandstones in the Malanggou Formation within the mid-part of the Yishu fault zone are studied. The results show that the provenance of the Malanggou Formation in the Dasheng Group was dominated by felsic volcanic rocks, and its sedimentation was in an arid and oxidized climate environment. The provenance of the Malanggou Formation was in a continental island arc setting. The major element concentrations and CIA value indicate that the Malanggou Formation has suffered weak chemical weathering. The abrasion of quartz and the trace element concentrations indicate that the Malanggou Formation is a set of proximal deposit. Detrital zircon age of the sandstone in Malanggou Formation can be divided into two age groups: 117-141 and 1852-2499 Ma. According to the age data of 117-141 Ma, the western Shandong uplift should be the main provenance of the Malanggou Formation, while according to the age data of 1852-2499 Ma, the Yishui Group in the Gongdanshan uplift had a certain contribution to the provenance of the Malanggou Formation.},

   abstract = {As a record of oceanic subduction, an accretionary complex plays a key role in the reconstruction of plate tectonic history. The Kekesentao ophiolitic melange between the Chinese Altai orogen to the north and the Kazakhstan collage to the south played an important role in the subduction-accretion of the Chinese Altai in the Palaeozoic. This article provides new structural field relations, and petrographic, geochemical, and geochronologic data for the Kekesentao ophiolitic melange, and detrital zircon analyses of turbidites that are imbricated with the melange. The Kekesentao melange consists of ultramafic rocks, meta-gabbros, pillow basalts, cherts, and imbricated trench turbidites, tuffaceous sandstones and quartz schists (ocean plate stratigraphy). The melange shows a 'block in matrix' structure in the field, and the general imbricated dip of the thrust system is to the N-NE, indicating southward accretion. Pillow basalts and meta-gabbros have a typical N-MORB geochemical signature, and the U-Pb zircon age of a meta-gabbro, interpreted as the age of pre-subduction oceanic crust, is Early Devonian (399-393 Ma). The upper time limit of accretion of the melange is constrained by a Late Devonian (361 Ma) intrusive granitic pluton. Detrital zircon ages of surrounding turbidites range from 369 to 3,114 Ma, which is typical of magmatic 540-460 Ma zircons from the Chinese Altai, suggesting that the Chinese Altai arc was the source of zircons in the melange. The Kekesentao ophiolite was accreted to the accretionary complex before the Late Devonian. Our analysis of structures, ocean plate stratigraphy, and zircon isotopic provenance of the Kekesentao ophiolitic melange and turbidites provides a robust conclusion that southward growth of the accretionary complex in the Kekesentao area of the Chinese Altai was semi-continuous from the Early Palaeozoic to Devonian.},

   abstract = {The Mongol-Okhotsk Belt, a major structural element of East Asia, is probably the youngest orogenic segment within the Central Asian Orogenic Belt. However, the timing of final closure of the Mongol-Okhotsk Ocean remains unresolved. Here, we present detrital zircon U-Pb-Hf isotopic data and whole-rock geochemical data (major and trace elements and Sm-Nd isotopes) for the metasedimentary rocks from the Un'ya-Bom Terrane, Dzhagdy Terrane, and the eastern part of the Tukuringra Terrane. Our new zircon U-Pb ages suggest that all sedimentary formations along the Dzhagdy Transect are early Mesozoic in age, rather than Paleozoic as previously thought. The detrital zircons from the metasedimentary rocks in the Un'ya-Bom Terrane, the Dzhagdy Terrane, and the eastern part of the Tukuringra Terrane yielded the youngest concordant ages of 194 +/- 4, 193 +/- 2, and 171 +/- 2 Ma, respectively. Moreover, we note that the so-called sedimentary formations of these terranes are not single sedimentary sequences as previously suggested, but a set of an olistostrome or tectonic melanges composed of rocks of different ages and origins. These sedimentary formations are probably relics of the Mongol-Okhotsk remnant basin that formed in the "gaps" between the southern margin of the North Asian Craton and the Amur Block during their collision. The absence of detrital zircons younger than 171 Ma in the sedimentary rocks of the Mongol-Okhotsk basin implies that the final closure of this basin could have taken place at the boundary of the Early and Middle Jurassic as a result of the collision or the development of the Mongol-Okhotsk orogenic belt in this region. After that, the Mongol-Okhotsk Belt underwent intense deformation related to within-plate strike-slip faulting, which could be attributed to the late Mesozoic rotation of the North Asian Craton relative to the continental massifs of East Asia.

Zircon grains from Paleoproterozoic metasediment of the LHCS yield U-Pb crystallization ages from 1614 +/- 14 Ma to 2679 +/- 14 Ma with a single distinct peak in the age spectra at 1870 Ma. epsilon Hf values from zircon in the LHCS range from 1 to -8. In contrast, zircon grains from the Neoproterozoic pGHS yield U-Pb crystallization ages from 481 +/- 10 Ma to 2560 +/- 8 Ma with a single distinct peak at 860 Ma. epsilon Hf values from these zircons range from 13 to -21. The oGHS yields zircon grains with U-Pb crystallization ages from 416 +/- 2 Ma to 2740 +/- 2 Ma with a single distinct peak at 472 Ma. These grains often exhibit older inherited cores ranging from similar to 800 Ma to similar to 2740 Ma with Ordovician rims (416 Ma to 510 Ma). The epsilon Hf values of zircon grains in the oGHS have two distinct modes: the similar to 860 Ma inherited zircon cores have a similar range to the similar to 860 Ma zircons from the pGHS (13 to -21), whereas the similar to 480 Ma rims range from -7 to -11. The detrital zircon U-Pb age spectra from the pGHS in the Garhwal region differs significantly from the U-Pb age spectra in other parts of the range (Nepal and Bhutan). These differences indicate wide lateral variations in provenance for the various source regions of the pGHS. Comparisons of the U-Pb and Hf data from the Garhwal region with potential -1800 Ma source regions show overlap with metasediments of the Aravalli shield of India. In the pGHS the most juvenile epsilon Hf values overlap with those of the northern Arabian Nubian Shield in Israel. However, these rocks show little crustal contamination at similar to 800 Ma, whereas the pGHS has significant crustal contamination at similar to 860 Ma. The Ordovician oGHS has epsilon Hf values that match the average eHf values of the paragneiss implying that it was sourced from the paragneiss. Although the nature of this Ordovician igneous event is still poorly understood, it is clear that the Hf isotopes can provide further insight into the petrogenesis of the magmatic rocks associated with it.

   abstract = {Arid and semi arid northern China holds some of the world's most significant sand sea and loess deposits. In particular, arguably the most important late Cenozoic wind-blown dust archives on land are exposed on the Chinese Loess Plateau. The origin of this loess-forming dust and its relationship to adjacent sand seas is unclear and has been the subject of considerable debate. Polarization of opinion over the sources of loess also reflects uncertainty over its relationship to large river systems and to the sources of proximal desert sands. It is critical to resolve this in order to elucidate the origins of sand seas, to determine the activity of past dust emitting regions and to fully exploit loess climate archives. Here we combine zircon U-Pb, fission-track and double dating with heavy mineral analysis to test the role of proximal deserts and rivers in contributing dust to the Loess Plateau. We focus on the Mu Us desert to test hypotheses over its sediment sources and because previous studies have often presented contrasting interpretations over its importance as a loess source. Spatial complexity of zircon ages and heavy mineral assemblages in Mu Us sand rules out significant aeolian mixing and shows that grains originating in northern Tibet dominate in the western Mu Us, with local sources dominating in the east of the desert. The western Mu Us far-travelled grains are shown to be delivered by the Yellow River and associated systems. Crucially, the western Mu Us grains and Yellow River grains show U-Pb age distributions and heavy mineral assemblages virtually identical to those of the Quaternary loess. Thus, our results demonstrate that the Yellow River and associated systems transports large quantities of sediment from northern Tibet to the Mu Us desert and further suggest that the river contributes a significant volume of material to the Loess Plateau. This provides the first evidence of a genetic link between the Yellow River and formation of the Chinese Loess Plateau and suggests a greater role for fluvial activity in past dust and desert sand sea formation.

We report petrological, detrital zircon U-Pb geochronological, trace element geochemical and Lu-Hf isotopic compositions for metasedimentary rocks from the Shigu Group in the Zhongza Terrane, SW China. The Shigu Group has been regarded as the Precambrian basement of the Zhongza Terrane, and comprises mainly a suite of medium-/low-grade metamorphosed terrigenous clastic rocks. The youngest zircon age population of two metasedimentary rock samples from the bottom Shigu Group yields a weighted average age of 633???9?Ma, indicative of a late Neoproterozoic (ca. 630?Ma) maximum deposition age. The youngest detrital zircon age of a metasedimentary rock from the upper Shigu Group is 597???7?Ma, it may suggesting a considerably later deposition. Detrital zircon age distribution patterns of the Shigu Group metasedimentary rocks are similar to those of coeval sedimentary rocks in the western Yangtze Block. According to Hf isotope compositions and zircon morphology, the Neoproterozoic Shigu Group detritus may have sourced from Neoproterozoic magmatic rocks in the western Yangtze Block, whilst the pre-Neoproterozoic zircons might originate from recycling of the underlying metasedimentary rocks. Our results indicate that the basement of the Zhongza Terrane was a continuation of the Yangtze Block, which implies that Precambrian Yangtze basement rocks were present beyond the current boundary of the Block. In the late Neoproterozoic (ca. 630?570?Ma), the western Yangtze Block may have been facing the Proto-Tethys and received detritus mainly from the local Neoproterozoic magmatic rocks. During the late Neoproterozoic-earliest Palaeozoic (ca. 570?520?Ma), the seaway closure between the Yangtze (incl. Zhongza) Block and northern India likely created new pathways for delivery of the earliest Neoproterozoic and Pan-African detrital zircons into the lowermost Palaeozoic sequences in South China.},

U-Pb geochronology and Lu-Hf isotope analyses were carried out on detrital zircons across this unconformity and also the associated granites in the western Jiangnan Orogen in this study. Our new results, combined with previous data, indicate that the Sibao and Danzhou groups were deposited at 860-832 and 803-764 Ma, respectively. Thus, this unconformity was constrained to be 832-803 Ma. Detrital zircons from the Sibao and Danzhou groups have generally similar age populations, with three major peaks at 2000-1550, 1000-880, and 850-830 (760) Ma and one minor at 2600-2400 Ma. The most important generation of juvenile crust appears to have occurred at 2600-2400 Ma. Both recycling of ancient crustal materials and addition of juvenile mantle components took place in the time intervals of 2000-1550 and 1000-880 Ma. Detrital zircons in the age population of 850-830 (760) Ma were probably derived from proximal magmatic rocks in the western Jiangnan Orogen, reflecting fast erosion of newly formed igneous rocks. The Sibao and equivalents were deformed and intruded by granites posterior to the deposition of the Sibao and equivalent sequences after 832 Ma but before deposition of the Danzhou and equivalent units before 803 Ma. The pre-Danzhou deformation marked a collision along the southeast margin of the Yangtze Craton. The regional angular unconformity sealed the Jiangnan Orogeny, and thus the collision between the Yangtze and Cathaysia blocks was during 832-803 Ma. The Danzhou and equivalent units unconformably overlying the Sibao Group record the onset of rifting along the southeastern Yangtze margin beginning around 803 Ma.},

   abstract = {Fifteen sandstone samples taken from pre-Cretaceous strata of the Yangtze Block are analysed to constrain the evolution of the South China Block, especially the assembly between the Yangtze and Cathaysia blocks. The results show that the maximum depositional age of the Neoproterozoic Lengjiaxi Group adjacent to the Cathaysia Block is c. 830 Ma, differing from that of the Kunyang and Dahongshan groups (> 960 Ma) on the southwestern margin of the Yangtze Block. The detrital zircons from Palaeozoic samples from the Yangtze Block have similar age populations to those in the Cathaysia Block, and they may originate from the Cathaysia Block according to palaeogeographic, palaeocurrent and former research data. The detrital zircons of Middle-Upper Jurassic sandstones in the southwestern and central Yangtze Block yield dominant age populations at 2.0-1.7 Ga and subordinate groups of 2.6-2.4 Ga, 0.8-0.7 Ga and 0.6-0.4 Ga. The Upper Triassic strata may be derived from the southern Yangtze and North China blocks due to the collisions between the Indosina, South China and North China blocks, whereas the Jurassic sediments may be partly derived from uplift and erosion of the Jiangnan Orogen due to an intracontinental orogeny induced by Pacific subduction towards the Eurasia Plate. The detrital age spectra and provenance data for basement in the South China Block are analysed and compared with each other. The South China Block has affinity with Australia not only in the Columbia supercontinent but also in the Rodinia supercontinent. We infer the existence of an ancient orogen under the western Jiangnan Orogen, which may have occurred during the Columbia age, earlier than the Sibao orogeny. This is supported by seismic profile proof from the SinoProbe.},

   abstract = {The radial sand ridge system (RSRS) located at Jiangsu coast of China attracts much attention on its origin and mechanic of formation for its special structure and potential land resource. Due to complicated hydrodynamic condition, the Jiangsu RSRS is a hot debated on its potential sources, Yangtze River or Yellow River? We collected ten sand samples from surface sediments along the west coast of Bohai Sea and Yellow Sea from the modern Yellow River estuary to Yangtze River estuary in summer, 2013. The samples are analyzed by method of detrital zircon age for source identification of the RSRS sediments. The U-Pb age spectra of detrital zircon grains of the samples show a wide range from Cenozoic to Late Archean with several age peaks. Comparing the age spectra between the Yangtze River and the Yellow River, the detrital zircons have younger age (< 100 Ma) group in the Yangtze River. These age distribution of the Jiangsu coastal RSRS sediments are similar to that of the Yangtze River, but different from the Yellow River. The samples located adjacent to the old Yellow River Delta show more wide-range age distribution, implying a compounded origination from the both rivers. Based on these findings it is proposed that, contrary to common opinion, the main sediment source of the Jiangsu RSRS is the Yangtze River, rather than the Yellow River. By implication, there should be evidence of hydrodynamic mechanics of oceanic currents and tidal motion. This aspect awaits confirmation in future research.},

In this study, U-Pb geochronology of detrital zircon was used to constrain the source terranes, understand the sedimentary provenance, and reconstruct the provenance evolution in the late Miocene. Measured age populations from the upper Miocene sediments indicate that the sediments in the Central Canyon were mainly derived from the sources of the Red River and central Vietnam, whereas the nearby Hainan Island was not the major source terrane. The southwestern Yangtze Block was likely the primary source for the head of the Central Canyon through the Red River system and played an important role in contributing detritus to the northwestern South China Sea during the late Miocene. The results of this study also showed slight provenance variations in the vertical stratigraphic successions of the upper Miocene, suggesting a relatively stable and continuous detritus supply from the Red River at 10.5-8.2 Ma. In addition, the provenance study is capable to provide important insights in reservoir distribution and quality evaluation in future exploration and production.},

   abstract = {Magmatic and structural tempos have been recognized in continental magmatic arcs, such as Cordilleran and Andean arcs. However, it remains unclear whether similar tempos or episodicity occur in back-arc settings, knowledge of which would be crucial for understanding back-arc geodynamics. The western Liaoning (WL) region in eastern China contains well-preserved basins of Jurassic-Cretaceous age and provides an opportunity to investigate back-arc tectonic processes. We present stratigraphic, structural, and geochronological data from the WL region to constrain tectonic evolution during the Jurassic-Cretaceous. The results show four stages of rifting or extension during 190-168, 167-137, 136-97, and 96-70 Ma, indicating a duration of 20-40 Myr for each extensional stage. Aside from a magmatic lull at 96-70 Ma, volcanism was associated with each of the three earlier extensional stages. Each main period of volcanism had a duration of 10-20 Myr, with the main eruption events occurring on an average cycle of-25 Myr. The Jurassic-Cretaceous extension and rifting were interrupted by three compressional events at 168-167, 137-136, and 97-96 Ma, as evidenced by angular unconformities, basin inversion, and structural shortening. Each episode of compression lasted for-1 Myr, on a 30-40 Myr cycle. The results indicate tempos in both back-arc stress state and magmatism. The back-arc tectonic evolution was characterized by frequent alternation of long-lived extensional and short-lived compressional events, and the back-arc magmatism in all cases occurred in an extensional setting. The back-arc tectonic tempos can be explained by a slab-driven model involving control by alternating phases of slab rollback and retreat on back-arc stress states and magmatism.

   abstract = {The Higo and Manotani high-T metamorphic rocks belong to the Higo terrane, central Kyushu, Japan. This terrane has been suggested as the eastern extension of the North China-South China collision zone based mainly on the similar petrological and geochronological data to the north Dabie high-grade rocks. In this study, detrital zircon U-Pb dating for the Higo metamorphic rocks yielded a maximum depositional age of 197 Ma with a prominent component at 193-284 Ma (62-95%) and a subsidiary peak at 1847-1875 Ma (19-28%); whereas for the Manotani metamorphic rocks, the maximum depositional age is 263 Ma with a prominent component at 263-304 Ma (98%). These results suggest that the protoliths of the Higo and Manotani metamorphic rocks might be equivalent to those of the early-middle Jurassic Chizu and late Triassic Suo high-P metamorphic rocks, southwest Japan, respectively. The absence of middle Neoproterozoic detrital zircon (c. 700-825 Ma) is incompatible with a proposition that the proto-Japan might have been located close to the South China craton, where Permian-Jurassic sedimentary rocks contain a significant amount of middle Neoproterozoic detrital zircon. The zircon provenance of the Higo terrane, as well as of the Chizu and Suo belts, could therefore be the North China craton, suggesting that the Suo metamorphic rocks, including the Manotani metamorphic rocks, have formed at the subduction plate boundary in the east, which changed into the contemporaneous North China-South China collision plate boundary in the west, likely passing through the Korean Peninsula. The transformation of the Chizu and Suo metamorphic rocks to the Higo and Manotani metamorphic rocks can be accounted for by the oceanward advance of the volcanic arc during trench retreating. The Cretaceous high-T metamorphism and related igneous intrusions of the Higo terrane would be regarded as the initial phase of the Ryoke event.},

   abstract = {The North Qinling Terrane was a microcontinent in the Late Neopmterozoic and then subducted northwards beneath the North China Craton for regional metamorphism in the Early Paleozoic. In order to constrain its location in supercontinent Rodinia, metasedimentary rocks were sampled from it for a combined study of whole-rock major and trace elements as well as zircon U-Pb ages and Lu-Hf isotopes. The metasedimentary rocks show greywacke compositions with A/CNK ratios of 0.99-1.28 and upper continental crust-like trace element patterns. They have metamorphic ages of ca. 510-490 Ma, recording continental collision for the regional metamorphism. The youngest detrital zircon U-Pb ages from three metasedimentary rocks are 1161 +/- 54 Ma, 954 +/- 15 Ma, 861 +/- 10 Ma, respectively. In combination with ages of granitic intrusions of 960 to 890 Ma in the target region, their deposition ages are constrained to be 1110-960 Ma, ca. 960 Ma and ca. 860 Ma, respectively. The cumulative proportions of the difference between the detrital zircon crystallization ages and the deposition ages for the sediments of ca. 960 Ma and ca. 860 Ma suggest their deposition in a collisional setting. Detrital zircon age spectrum from the Qinling Group yields two major populations at 1000-900 Ma and 1700-1400 Ma and three subordinate populations at 900-800 Ma, 1300-1200 Ma and 1800-1700 Ma with rare Neoarchean grains. Neoproterozoic detrital zircons mainly have negative epsilon(Hf)(t) values, consistent with Neopmterozoic granitoids in the North Qinling Terrane. On the other hand, Mesoprotemzoic detrital zircons mainly have positive epsilon(Hf)(t) values, similar to those in East Laurentia and East Greenland. This means that the major provenance of sediments in the Qinling Group was the North Qinling Terrane itself and East Laurentia, supporting the connection between the North Qinling Terrane and East Laurentia in Rodinia prior to its breakup. In combination with the coeval strata in the southern margin of the North China Craton, we propose that the North Qinling Terrane is a missing piece connecting the southern margin of the North China Craton with the northern part of East Laurentia in Rodinia in the early Neoprotemzoic.},

   abstract = {The Lower Cretaceous sedimentary strata in the Lhasa Terrane record the palaeogeographic and tectonic history of the Tibetan Plateau prior to the India-Asia collision. The Lower Cretaceous strata in the Coqen Basin of the northern Lhasa subterrane include the Duoni and Langshan Formations. The Duoni Formation is composed of conglomerates, sandstones, siltstones and mudstones in the south deposited in a fluvial environment and quartzose-lithic sandstones, siltstones and mudstones in the north deposited in a shelf-coastal environment. The overlying Langshan Formation is characterized by abundant Orbitolina- and rudist-bearing wackestones and packstones, which were deposited on a low-energy carbonate ramp. The Langshan Formation in the Cocien Basin was deposited between similar to 119-115 Ma and similar to 98 Ma based on its large benthic foraminiferal assemblages. Age constraints based on the interbedded tuff and conformably overlying Langshan Formation indicate that the Duoni Formation was deposited between similar to 123 and 115 Ma. Sandstone detrital modal compositions further indicate that the Duoni Formation was primarily derived from magmatic arc and recycled orogen sources. Detrital zircons from the Duoni Formation yield a primary age population of 160-110 Ma (peaking at similar to 130 Ma), with negative cHf(t) values (-18.7 to 2.7), and additional age ranges of 550-500, 1200-900, and 1600-1500 Ma, thereby indicating that the Zenong volcanic rocks and Palaeozoic sedimentary bedrocks in the northern Lhasa subterrane are the most likely sources. The palaeogeography of the northern Lhasa subterrane can be approximately described in two stages. During the Aptian (similar to 123-115 Ma), with the eruption of the Zenong volcanic rocks, the Duoni Formation accumulated in fluvial and shelf-coastal environments and was sourced from the Zenong volcanic rocks and basement rocks from the southern region of the northern Lhasa subterrane. The enhanced magmatic activities in the northern Lhasa subterrane may have influenced the Duoni Formation deposition. During the Late Aptian-Early Cenomanian (similar to 115-98 Ma), a north-south transgression occurred, causing the majority of the northern Lhasa region to be dominated by shallow-marine limestones of the Langshan Formation.

   abstract = {The Mesozoic trench deposits in the Bangong-Nujiang suture zone in central Tibet can provide critical information for reconstructing the paleotectonic evolution of the Bangong-Nujiang Ocean and constraining the timing of the Lhasa-Qiangtang initial collision. In this paper, the Gamulong Formation, which is well exposed in the Dong Co area, western Bangong-Nujiang suture, central Tibet, was studied. The sedimentological analysis shows that the Gamulong Formation was deposited in a submarine fan environment. The youngest detrital zircon age and fossils from limestone pebbles within the Gamulong Formation combine to determine a Middle Jurassic age. The pebbles in the conglomerate are dominated by limestones and sandstones, which is consistent with the sandstone petrology showing limestone and sandstone fragments as the main framework components. Detrital zircon U-Pb ages from the sandstones yield age populations of 164-178 Ma, 200-500 Ma, 700-1000 Ma, 1700-2100 Ma and similar to 2500 Ma. The corresponding zircon epsilon(Hf)(t) values are distributed between - 23.5 and + 11.1. These zircon features are similar to those from the Qiangtang terrane. Accordingly, the provenance results imply that the Gamulong Formation was recycled from the accretionary complex (Mugagangri Group melange) in the Bangong-Nujiang suture zone and the forearc basin deposits (Lower-Middle Jurassic Sewa/Shaqiaomu/Jiebuqu formations) in the southern Qiangtang subterrane. The Gamulong Formation is characterized by sedimentary recycling in the trench, likely in response to a tectonic event (possibly the continental collision). Together with the previous studies, this work on the occurrence of the Gamulong Formation indicates that the Lhasa-Qiangtang initial collision could have occurred in Middle Jurassic time (similar to 166 Ma).},

   abstract = {The tectonic evolution of the Lhasa terrane (southern Tibetan Plateau) played a fundamental role in the formation of the Tibetan Plateau. However, many uncertainties remain with regard to the tectonic and paleogeographic evolution of the Lhasa terrane prior to the India-Asia collision. To determine the early tectonic processes that controlled the topographic evolution of the Lhasa terrane, we analyze the Cretaceous strata exposed in the Coqen Basin (northern Lhasa subterrane), which comprises the Langshan and Daxiong Formations. The Langshan Formation unconformably overlies the volcanic rocks of the Lower Cretaceous Zelong Group and consists of similar to 80 m of Orbitolina-bearing limestones, which were deposited in a low-energy, shallow marine environment. Micropaleontological analysis indicates that the Langshan Formation in the Coqen Basin was deposited from late Aptian to early Cenomanian times (ca. 113-96 Ma). The overlying Daxiong Formation (similar to 1700 m thick) consists of conglomerate, coarse sandstone, and siltstone with interbedded mudstone, and represents deposits of alluvial fans and braided rivers. The Daxiong Formation was deposited after the early Cenomanian (ca. 96 Ma) and accumulated until at least ca. 91 Ma, indicating accumulation rates of greater than 0.3 km m.y.(-1). By combining paleocurrent data, sandstone petrology, detrital zircon U-Pb ages, and Hf isotope analysis, we demonstrate that the Daxiong Formation was derived from Lower Cretaceous volcanic rocks and pre-Cretaceous strata in the northern Lhasa subterrane. During Late Cretaceous time, two thrust systems with opposite vergence were responsible for transforming the northern Lhasa subterrane into an elevated mountain range. This process resulted in the evolution from a shallow marine environment (Langshan Formation) into a terrestrial depositional environment (Daxiong Formation) on the southern margin of the northern Lhasa subterrane. Given the regional paleogeographic context, we conclude that the Daxiong Formation in the Coqen Basin records local crustal shortening and flexure resulting in foreland basin development on the southern margin of the northern Lhasa subterrane, which implies early topographic growth of the northern Lhasa subterrane in southern Tibet prior to the India-Asia collision.},

   abstract = {The Helanshan Tectonic Belt is situated among the Qilian Orogenic Belt to the southwest, the Alxa Massif to the west and the Ordos Block to the east. The Helanshan Tectonic Belt has received increasing attention since it was argued as the plate boundary separating the Alxa Massif from the Ordos Block, and hence Alxa Massif was isolated from the North China Craton during Triassic. The Middle to Upper Triassic strata in the northwestern Ordos and the Helanshan Tectonic Belt witnessed the tectonic evolutionary processes between the Alxa Massif and the Ordos Basin, hence are pivotal to understand the relationship between the Alxa Massif and the North China Craton. In this work, integrated paleocurrent orientation, gravel component, sandstone modal composition and detrital zircon U-Pb isotopic analyses were applied to trace the source area and reconstruct the sourceto-sink relations between the Abca Massif and Ordos Basin. The southeast orientated paleocurrent directions suggest detritus in the northwestern Ordos were mostly sourced from the northwest. Clastic compositions reveal a mixed orogeny provenance, including magmatic arc and continental block sources. Detrital zircons from four sandstones in the Helanshan Tectonic Belt yields four major LA-ICPMS U-Pb age groups of 2600-2200 Ma, 2000-1700 Ma, 480-400 Ma and 350-200 Ma, suggesting multiple-sourced provenance. Comparing to the magmatic records in the Alxa Massif and the Qilian Orogenic Belt, the Triassic detritus in the Helanshan Tectonic Belt were mainly from the Alxa Massif with additional supplements from the Qilian Orogenic Belt, which finally debouched to the lacustrine in the interior Ordos Basin to the southeast. Triassic basin evolution of the northwestern Ordos was further associated with post-collision in the Alxa Massif after the closure of the Paleo-Asian Ocean.},

   abstract = {The end-Proterozoic to Ordovician paleogeographic relationship of the northern Tibetan terranes with the Gondwana is poorly constrained. Most models have hypothetically regarded them as outboard ribbons isolated in the Proto-Tethyan Ocean. In this study, we employed zircon U-Pb geochronologic data from sedimentary units below and above a Neoproterozoic-Cambrian unconformity in the Olongbuluke Terrane (OLT) to show a transition in source from the OLT to the Gondwana at end-Neoproterozoic. The Precambrian sandstones contain the OLT originated zircons with consistent age spectra characterized by crystallization ages of 2700-1750 Ma. By contrast, Cambro-Ordovician sandstones yield a broad age range of 3580-490 Ma, dominated by a primary age cluster peaking at similar to 980 Ma. This age distribution displays a strong similarly with those for coeval sediments in the South China, Qiangtang and Himalaya, indicating a common source from the Indian Gondwana. The shared source requires the OLT to have a paleogeographic continuity with the northern India being a member of peri-Gondwana assemblages. Chronological studies assigned an end-Neoproterozoic age of similar to 580 to 550 Ma for the uppermost unit below the unconformity, while the lowest Cambrian has an initial depositional age of similar to 515 Ma, constraining a similar to 550 to 515 Ma age interval for the stratigraphic break. We invoke the similar to 550 to 515 Ma as the timing for the accretion of OLT onto the Greater Indian lithosphere, synchronous with the final assembly of Gondwana in the Indo-Australian portion. In combination with correlation of age spectra for the OLT with those for other tectonic units in the northern Tibet, our interpretation infers that the northern Tibetan terranes should have been subjected to the evolution of the Greater Indian lithosphere in the early-Paleozoic. This refined tectonic scenario provides a pioneering perspective to view the dynamic mechanism of tectonic evolution for the northern Tibet in the global Gondwana amalgamation context.},

Two groups of zircons, i.e., magmatic and metamorphic in origin, have been identified based on cathodoluminescence images, zircon Ti-temperatures and Th/U ratios. Zircon U-Pb dating shows two main magmatic events with ages of 2.55-2.47 Ga and 1.80-1.70 Ga, and four metamorphic events, with ages of 2.51-2.48 Ga, 1.96-1.90 Ga, 1.87-1.85 Ga and similar to 1.80 Ga in the NCC. No zircons with ages of similar to 3.8 Ga have been identified in this study, indicating either these were covered at the time of deposition or the limited presence of 3.8 Ga rocks in the NCC. The Hf isotopic data show the similar to 2.5 Ga magmatic zircons have variable epsilon(Hf)(t) values, including both positive and negative values and with crustal model ages of 2.7-2.9 Ga, which can be interpreted to indicate mixed sources for their parental rocks, i.e., ancient crust (3.8 Ga or 3.3 Ga) and depleted mantle, implying significant continental crustal growth at similar to 2.5 Ga. However, Paleoproterozoic magmatic zircons all have negative epsilon(Hf)(t) and Archean Hf model ages, suggesting that their parental rocks were formed from recycled Archean materials. The widespread similar to 2.5 Ga metamorphism in the Eastern Block, coupled with extensive similar to 2.5 Ga magmatism and crustal growth, are consistent with a mantle plume beneath the Eastern Block of the NCC during the Neoarchean. Whereas, a progressive increase in similar to 1.85 Ga metamorphic zircon westward across the Eastern Block toward the Trans-North China orogen is best explained by collision between the Eastern and Western blocks at this time.

   abstract = {The Helanshan Tectonic Belt and its environs within the northwestern Ordos Terrane, western North China Craton, have been envisaged as aulacogen or plate boundary separating the Alxa Massif from the Ordos Block during Cambrian. However, it conflicts with geological and geophysical facts. This study presents integrated stratigraphic, sedimentary and geochronological data from the Cambrian strata in the northwestern Ordos Terrane to constrain the Cambrian tectonic evolutionary process of the western North China Craton. The Cambrian successions comprise, in ascending order, evaporite platform facies, restricted-open platform facies and evaporite platform facies, featuring a vertical transgression-regression sequence. An eastward-shoaling paleogeography was documented, evidenced by shallow-water dolomite layers enriched in the east and the detritus derived from northeast. Ages of detrital zircons span from 2566 to 1649Ma with predominant two peaks around 2500 and 1850Ma, suggesting these Cambrian detritus were sourced from the Archean-Paleoproterozoic rocks in the Yimeng highland. Comparable fossil associations and unified paleogeography system supported that there was no Cambrian plate boundary in the northwestern Ordos Terrane, implying the Alxa Massif was part of the North China Craton during the Cambrian. The westward-deepening facies differentiation with low-angle topography contradicts with the tectonic model of Helan aulacogen. In combination with the relatively low subsidence rate and rare magmatic-metamorphic activities, we argue that the Cambrian shallow marine system in the western North China Craton was the continent-ward extension of passive continental margin basin system related to the spreading of the Paleo-Asian Ocean.},

   abstract = {The western North China Craton (W-NCC) comprises the Alxa Terrane in the west and the Ordos Block in the east; they are separated by the Helanshan Tectonic Belt (HTB). There is an extensive debate regarding the significant Ordovician tectonic setting of the W-NCC. Most paleogeographic reconstructions emphasized the formation and rapid subsidence of an aulacogen along the HTB during the Middle-Late Ordovician, whereas paleomagnetic and geochronologic results suggested that the Alxa Terrane and the Ordos Block were independent blocks separated by the HTB. In this study, stratigraphic and geochronologic methods were used to constrain the Ordovician tectonic processes of the W-NCC. Stratigraphic correlations show that the Early Ordovician strata comprise similar to 500-m-thick tidal flat and lagoon carbonate successions with a progressive eastward onlap, featuring a west-deepening shallow-water carbonate shelf. In contrast, the Late Ordovician strata are composed of similar to 3,000-m-thick abyssal turbidites in the west and similar to 400-m-thick shallow-water carbonates in the east, defining an eastward-tapering basin architecture. Early Ordovician detrital zircons with ages of similar to 2,800-1,700 Ma were derived from the Ordos Block; the Late Ordovician turbidites were sourced from the western Alxa Terrane, based on zircon ages clustered at similar to 1,000-900 Ma. The petrographic modal composition and zircon age distribution imply a provenance shift from a stable craton to a recycled orogen in the Middle Ordovician. These shifts define a tectonic conversion from a passive continental margin to a foreland basin at similar to 467 Ma, resulting in the eastward progradation of the turbidite wedge around the HTB, the eastward backstepping of the carbonate platform in the east and the eastward expansion of orogenic thrusting in the western Alxa Terrane. This tectono-sedimentary shift coincided with the advancing subduction of the southern Paleo-Asian Ocean beneath the Alxa Terrane, generating the western Alxa continental arc and the paired retro-arc foredeep in the east under a compressional tectonic regime.},

   abstract = {The Late Palaeozoic dynamic setting of the Ordos Basin in the southwestern North China Craton (SW-NCC) is poorly constrained due to limited understanding on the source-to-sink relation. This study presents integrated provenance clues from the Permian strata in the southwestern Ordos Basin to trace the sources and to discuss the tectonic setting of the basin in the SW-NCC. The reconstructed palaeocurrent directions of these Permian sediments generally point to the northeast and suggest the dominant sedimentary influx from the southwest. Modal composition analysis shows the Permian deposits have an overwhelming derivation from mixed sources containing orogeny, continental block, and magmatic arc. Zircons from the lower section yield major age clusters of similar to 300-270 Ma and similar to 2,500-1,700 Ma. While, zircon age spectra for the upper section are marked by the abundance of similar to 1,000-800 Ma and similar to 500-400 Ma ages, and the lack of Permian populations. Sources of the lower section were interpreted to be the arc terrane along the southern border of SW-NCC, in contrast, sources of the upper part were attributed to the Central Qilian Block. Zircons of similar to 300-270 Ma indicate significant magmatic activities in a rapidly uplifting continental arc, yielding an additional clue for the subduction and the existence of the Mianlue Ocean in the northeastern Palaeo-Tethys. The changes in provenance and depositional rate at the Middle Permian indicate the rapid subsidence along with the intensive uplift of the continental basement in the SW-NCC. These signatures likely infer that the back-arc basin may have evolved into a compressional setting at that time.},

   abstract = {The late Mesoproterozoic to early Neoproterozoic strata in the Yangtze Block hold a key position in deciphering the tectonic evolution of the South China Block and implicate upon the reconstruction of the Rodinia super-continent. The sedimentological, geochronologic, and geochemical data on the Kunyang Group, southwestern Yangtze Block, were evaluated for a better understanding of the regional geodynamics and refinement in its paleoposition in the Rodinia supercontinent. Our findings constrain the deposition of the Kunyang Group sediments occurring during 1152 Ma and 1000 Ma, under a stable environment with alternating neritic and littoral facies sedimentation. In contrast, deposition of the Meidang Formation, traditionally thought to represent the upper part of the Kunyang Group, continued up to 866 Ma in an active setting at varying basin depths and hydrodynamic conditions. Moderate to high SiO2 contents (57.7-95.4 wt%), highly variable K2O/Na2O ratios (0.01-55.8), and critical trace element abundances (Zr: 57.6-578 ppm, Th: 1.95-28.3 ppm, Sc: 0.75-24.3 ppm), detrital zircon age distribution, sedimentological characteristics, and bimodal magmatism cumulatively underline a transition from continental rift to passive continental margin setting, followed by an active continental margin setting. The onset of oceanic subduction below the SW-NW margin of the Yangtze Block caused a hiatus in sedimentation, marked by an unconformity between the Kunyang Group and Meidang Formation. Paleocurrent data, zircon U-Pb ages, and Lu-Hf isotopic characteristics indicate that the Kunyang Group received detritus from some interior sources and exotic terranes, such as the Gawler Craton in Australia, the Transantarctic Mountains in East Antarctica, and the Ongole domain in the Eastern Dharwar Craton of India. The Yangtze Block was likely located to the west of Australia and East Antarctica and north of India in the Rodinia supercontinent. Paleocurrent data also confirm an external location for the Yangtze Block in the Rodinia paleogeographic configuration.},

Seismic interpretation shows that the Chengzihe, Muling and Dongshan formations of the Hegang Basin thicken eastwards with westwards onlap, indicating that the LXR existed as a palaeo-uplift during that period, whereas the Houshigou Formation shows no thickness change, indicating that the LXR was possibly under water at this time. This is supported by results of detrital zircon analysis from the Hegang Basin in which the Chengzihe Formation is dominated by approximately 180 Ma zircons, which can only be provided by the LXR, whereas the Houshigou Formation records no Early Jurassic ages. This view is consistent with previous studies of the Songliao Basin for a provenance change between the Denglouku and Quantou formations. We conclude that the LXR was a highland during deposition of the Chengzihe, Muling and Dongshan formations but that it was under water when the Houshigou Formation was deposited. There was thus a connection between the Hegang and Songliao basins, which marks an eastwards migration of the depositional and extensional centre of the Songliao-Hegang basin system. This eastwards migration implies lithospheric extension driven by palaeo-Pacific roll-back.},

   abstract = {The Wandashan Orogen of NE China is a typical accretionary orogen related to Paleo-Pacific subduction. The Raohe Complex, as a major part of the orogen, consists of mid-Triassic to mid-Jurassic radiolarian chert and intraoceanic igneous rocks in an accretionary prism overlain by weakly sheared terrestrial-sourced clastic trench slope sediments. Sensitive high-resolution ion microprobe U-Pb dating and LA-MC-ICPMS Hf isotopic analysis of detrital zircons from the terrestrial-sourced Yongfuqiao Formation sandstone show that most zircons are Phanerozoic (90%): 140-150Ma (10%), 180-220Ma (25%), 240-270Ma (15%), 300-360Ma (15%), 391-395Ma (3%), and 450-540Ma (20%), whereas 10% are Precambrian in age. About 90% of the zircons have epsilon(Hf)(t) values ranging from +11.1 to -12.8. This suggests that the major provenance of the trench slope sediments was from the adjacent eastern segment of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt and the Jiamusi Block. The age of the Yongfuqiao Formation is constrained to the earliest Cretaceous, which represents the accretion time of the mid-Triassic to mid-Jurassic oceanic complexes. When compared with the Mino Complex in Japan and the Tananao Complex in Taiwan, three different provenances are identified suggesting three ancient drainage systems which transported sediments from NE China, North China, and South China to the Paleo-Pacific subduction-accretion system.},

   abstract = {The Upper Taihua Complex in the Lushan area is one of the best preserved Paleoproterozoic metamorphic basements exposed in the southern North China Craton, which is mainly composed of Khondalite-dominated supracrustal rocks and associated meta-mafic intrusions (amphibolites) and granitic plutons. Detrital zircon U-Pb ages of four paragneisses from the supracrustal rocks can be divided into two groups: 2.39-2.10 Ga and 1.97-1.83 Ga. Concordant Pb-207/Pb-20S ages from the older group show typical magmatic features with a distinct peak around 2.31-2.23 Ga, whereas the metamorphic zircons define a remarkable age peak at similar to 1.93 Ga. Magmatic zircons from the amphibolite sample have a weighted mean Pb-207/Pb-206 age of 2128 +/- 29 Ma, representing the crystallization age of the protolith. Therefore, the depositional age of the supracrustal rocks in the Upper Taihua Complex can be well constrained at similar to 2.23-2.13 Ga. Geochemically, the amphibolites are classified as subalkaline high-Fe tholeiitic basalts in compositions and characterized by slightly enrichment in LREE, flat HREE and weakly negative Eu anomalies, with depleted high field strength elements (e.g., Nb, Ta, and Ti), inconsistent with typical rocks derived from the asthenospheric mantle. The high FeOT (>13.59wt%), CaO (>6.67wt%), low Al2O3 (<13.09wt%), Th (<3.09 ppm), and lack of correlation between epsilon(Nd)(t) values and crustal contamination sensitive elements suggest that crustal assimilation was limited during magma evolution. The varied epsilon(Nd)(t) values (-2.99 to +0.44) and Nd model ages (2.65-2.98 Ga) suggest that they were likely originated from Archean subcontinental lithospheric mantle (SCLM) which have been refertilized by metasomatic processes. These geochronological and geochemical signatures indicate the meta-mafic rocks and associated supracrustal rocks of the Upper Taihua Complex in the Lushan area were most likely formed in an intra-continental rift setting, implying the extensional tectonic scenario rather than subduction-related regime occurred between similar to 2.2 and 2.0 Ga at least in the southern margin of the NCC. Metamorphic ages suggest that the Taihua Complex in the Lushan area was involved in subduction-collision processes from 1.97 Ga to 1.83 Ga. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {The Fangniushan supracrustal strata located in Xiaoshan area is one of the best-preserved Paleoproterozoic lowgrade metasedimentary units exposed in the southern North China Craton, which is mainly composed of quartzite and feldspar quartzite with minor pebbly quartzite and conglomerates. It unconformably contacts with the underlying Taihua Complex and the overlying Paleoproterozoic Xiong'er Group. Ages of the youngest detrital zircons from the quartzites combined with the formation age of the overlying Xiong'er Group bracket the depositional time of the Fangniushan supracrustal strata at ca. 1.87-1.80 Ga. Low CIA ( < 70), ICV (0.48-1.46) values and high SiO2/Al2O3 (4.1-75.1) ratios for the Fangniushan metasedimentary rocks are suggestive of chemically mature source that experienced weak to moderate chemical weathering in their source areas, which is also supported by the A-CN-K signatures. Detrital zircon U-Pb ages of the Fangniushan metasedimentary rocks yield three populations of similar to 2.00 to 2.24 Ga, similar to 2.25 to 2.40 Ga and similar to 2.50 to 2.88 Ga. REE patterns combined with trace elements characteristics involving La, Th, Zr, Hf, Co and Sc reveal that the Fangniushan metasedimentary rocks dominantly received detritus from felsic sources in the Xiaoshan and adjacent Xiaoqinling, Xiong'ershan and Zhongtiaoshan areas. Taking all these geochronological and geochemical signatures into account, the Fangniushan supracrustal strata was most likely deposited in a retro-arc foreland setting. In combination with previous studies on other Paleoproterozoic metavolcanic-sedimentary sequences, we prefer that the southern NCC might have experienced tectonic regime change from rift to subduction during Paleoproterozoic.},

All of the strata probably formed in a subduction-related tectonic setting. The Kunyang Group (Heishantou Formation) and Huili Group (Tongan Formation) have maximum depositional ages of 960-1000 Ma and contain zircons whose ages are dominantly Paleoproterozoic (similar to 2500-2300, 1900-1700 and 1650-1500 Ma). The Yanbian Group has a zircon population ranging mainly from 860 to 1000 Ma, different from that of the Bikou Group with ages from 745 to 890 Ma. Ages of zircons from the Lieguliu and Guanyinya Formations range from 740 to 900 Ma. The Paleoproterozoic detrital zircons commonly have negative or slightly positive epsilon(Hf) values from -8.0 to +23, whereas most of the 1000-740 Ma zircons have moderately to significantly high positive epsilon(Hf) values from +03 to +13.0. The new detrital zircon U-Pb and Lu-Hf isotopic dataset suggests four major episodes of magmatism in the region (similar to 2500-2300,1900-1700,1650-1500 and 1000-740 Ma) and the presence of widespread Archean basement of the western Yangtze Block. The data also suggest an important period of juvenile magmatism at 1000-740 Ma. Our results favor a model in which continuous subduction (1000-740 Ma) along the western margin of the Yangtze Block lasted for 260 million years. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {The geometry and evolution of rivers originating from the Tibetan plateau are influenced by topography and climate change during the India-Asia collision. The Yangtze River is the longest among these rivers and formed due to capturing many rivers on the eastern Tibetan Plateau by the middle Yangtze. The timing of these capture events is still controversial. Here, we use detrital muscovite Ar-40/Ar-39 and zircon U-Pb ages to constrain the provenance of late Cenozoic sediments in the Jianghan Basin in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River. The combined data suggest that late Pliocene sediments were mainly derived from a local source in the Jianghan Basin including the Dabie Shan. The middle Pleistocene sediments were derived from the Min River west of the Three Gorges. This implies that at least one river, perhaps the palaeo-Han River, originating from the Dabie Shan region, flowed through the centre of the Jianghan Basin during the late Pliocene. The appearance of sediment from the Min River in the Jianghan Basin somewhere between late Pliocene and middle Pleistocene suggests that the Three Gorges section of the Yangtze River was formed somewhere between late Pliocene and middle Pleistocene (N-2- Q(2)).},

   abstract = {The Permian Solonker-Xar Moron River Suture in South Mongolia and Inner Mongolia of China represents a Major tectonic boundary in Asia. The position of its eastward continuation in northeastern China has been debated for many years. In order to resolve this debate, we measured detrital zircons of the Cisuralian (Early Permian) plant fossil-bearing Hesheng Formation in the Yanbian area, Jilin Province. The detrital zircons have ages of ca. 2541-2535 Ma, 1897-1832 Ma, 458-452 Ma, and 390-280 Ma. We therefore conclude that the depositional age of the Hesheng Formation is younger than ca. 280 Ma; this is consistent with paleontologic data that indicates an Artinskian-Early Kungurian age. The presence of Neoarchean and Paleoproterozoic zircons suggests that the Hesheng Formation may have a North-China affinity; the absence of Neoproterozoic and Pan-African zircons preclude detrital sources from the Jiamusi-Mongolia Block during the Cisuralian. This, combined with the Permian floristic and stratigraphic data, provides a clue that the Solonker-Xar Moron River Suture likely extends to the Wangqing-Hunchun region, in eastern Jilin Province.

   abstract = {The Neogene Guantao Formation has been proven to be one of the most important reservoirs in the Bohai Bay Basin (BBB), but its sediment provenance, sediment routing and dispersal have remained controversial. In this study, we perform an integrated of detrital zircon geochronology, heavy mineral assemblages and seismic-based analyses of the Guantao Formation to investigate the sediment provenance and reconstruct provenance interaction of multiple sediment sources. Our results show that the detrital zircon (DZ) age spectrums of Guantao Formation display significant spatial differences corresponding to the changing sources. DZ ages from the northern part of the Bodong area display a relatively complex age spectrum and are characterized by a multimodal distribution, indicating sediment contribution from Liaodong uplift (LDU). In contrast to the sediments from LDU, the southern part of the Bodong area was characterized by Yanshanian-dominated unimodal age spectra together with the absence of 170-180 Ma and Triassic age populations suggesting sediments sourced from the Jiaodong uplift (JDU). However, in the central part of the Bodong area, DZ ages exhibit Yanshanian-dominated unimodal age spectra but present 170-180 Ma and Triassic age populations. Combined with seismic-based provenance analysis and heavy mineral ZTR index study demonstrate that both the LDU and JDU have made important provenance contributions to the central part of the Bodong area. Consequently, the provenance intersection area can be trapped by samples sharing similar age signature in the three members (from base to top: NgL, N-8(M), and N-g(U)) of the Guantao Formation. These results shed light on the spatial and temporal provenance heterogeneity in such dynamic sediment-routing systems. Our findings may serve as a useful reference for reconstructing provenance interaction of multiple sediment sources in other types of petroliferous basins.},

   abstract = {East China experienced crustal extensions during the Early Cretaceous and the latest Cretaceous-Cenozoic. For a long time, previous studies have recognized a short-lived compressional event between these two extensional regimes during the early Late Cretaceous but not much attention has been paid to it, although it may shed new light on the tectonic evolution of East Asia and the mechanism of the North China Craton Destruction. The Jiaolai Basin, located at the margin of East China, consists of a thick succession of Cretaceous sedimentary rocks and thus may help in further interpreting the mechanism and influence of the short-lived compressional event. Here, we apply integrated sedimentological methods to sandstone samples of both the Lower Cretaceous Laiyang Group and Upper Cretaceous Wangshi Group. Our findings suggest that there was a provenance change in the Jiaolai Basin from the Early Cretaceous granitic and metamorphic rock origin to the Late Cretaceous basic-intermediate volcanic origin. Combined with the zircon U-Pb ages, we conclude that the provenance change was caused by the uplift of the coastal mountains along the East Asian margin, from the relatively distal Sulu orogenic belt and Jiaobei Terrane during the Early Cretaceous to the intra-basinal volcanic rocks of the Qingshan Groupduring the Late Cretaceous. After careful evaluation of the provenance histories, orogenic exhumations, widespread unconformities and paleoclimate changes that occurred in sedimentary basins both along the East Asian margin and in the hinterland, we finally estimate the possible range of influence and extent of the shortlived compression event during the early Late Cretaceous.},

   abstract = {Permo-Carboniferous provenance shifts at the northern margin of the North China Craton (NCC) were reconstructed. The reconstruction was based on the detrital zircon U-Pb-Hf data from Late Paleozoic sandstones from Ondor Sum and Wude in the Southern Orogenic Belt (SOB) of the Southeast Central Asian Orogenic Belt (SE CAOB). Sandstone samples from the Lower Devonian Naqing Formation, Upper Carboniferous Hailasiamu Formation, and the first and second members of the Upper Carboniferous Amushan Formation in Ondor Sum present a nearly unimodal detrital zircon age grouping (c. 380-520 Ma), and they have similar zircon Hf isotopic compositions with igneous rocks in the SOB, implying that their provenance was from the SOB region. In contrast, samples in the same area from the third to fifth members of the Lower Permian Amushan Formation and the Lower Permian Sanmianjing Formation contain multimodal age groupings, with the ages mainly concentrated at the Late Carboniferous-Early Permian, Neoarchean, and Paleoproterozoic. The coexistence of Neoarchean and Paleoproterozoic grains suggests that the NCC could be a reliable source. In addition, the Hf isotopic composition of the Late Carboniferous-Early Permian zircons overlap with those from the NCC, and therefore, it is concluded that there were Permo-Carboniferous provenance shifts from the SOB to the NCC for the sandstones from the Upper Paleozoic in the Ondor Sum area. Late Carboniferous and Early Devonian sandstone samples from Wude had sediment contributions from both the SOB and the NCC, with detrital zircon grains from the SOB constituting the majority. Whereas, the Early Permian samples from this area contained sediment contributions predominantly from the NCC. We suggest that the Permo-Carboniferous provenance shifts were the result of significant local subsidence of the SOB, and the uplift of the Inner Mongolia Paleo-Uplift after the Early Devonian collision between the Bainaimiao arc belt and the NCC.

   abstract = {The Fuping Complex is exposed at the central domain of the Trans-North China Orogen (TNCO). Here we report new zircon LA-ICP-MS U-Pb ages, Lu-Hf isotope data, and whole rock geochemistry on a suite of meta-granitoids, amphibolites and metasedimentary rocks from the Fuping Complex. Magmatic zircons from the gneissic granite and syenogranites yield weighted mean Pb-207/Pb-206 ages of 2050 +/- 21 Ma and 2077 +/- 16 Ma, respectively. Those in two amphibolites show weighted mean Pb-207/Pb-206 ages of 2054 +/- 26 Ma and 2044 +/- 61 Ma. Zircons in a felsic schist define two age populations of 2450-2585 Ga and 2004-2097 Ga, suggesting the Fuping TTG gneisses and Nanying gneissic granites as the provenance. Our data also indicate that the Wanzi supracrustal sequence was deposited between 1.95 and 1.84 Ga. The geochemical data suggest that the 2.1-2.0 Ga granitic rocks and amphibolites from the Fuping Complex formed in subduction-related arc setting. The granitoids show SiO2 content between 72.53 and 77.67 wt.% and classify as high-K shoshonitic, calc-alkalic to alkali granite. The amphibolites are subalkaline basalts in composition. Zircons from the 2.1-2.0 Ga granitoids and amphibolites display positive epsilon(Hf)(t) values in the range of 0.3-8.5 and Hf crustal model ages (T-DM(C)) from 2124 to 2639 Ma. The 2.1-2.0 Ga magmatic zircons in the Wanzi supracrustal assemblage show relatively lower epsilon(Hf)(t) values (-0.8 to -2.6) and Hf crustal model ages (T-DM(C)) of 2710-2801 Ma, suggesting that the magma sources of the 2.1-2.0 Ga suite included reworked 2.7-2.8 Ga crustal basement together with Neoarchean-Paleoproterozoic juvenile components. Based on the widespread 2.1-2.0 Ga magmatism as recorded in different rock types within the TNCO, we propose a tectonic model where we envisage simultaneous subduction and continental rifting process between several micro-blocks (or complexes). During 2.1-2.0 Ga, the Wutai Complex and the Fuping Complex were separated by the Longquanguan ocean. The double-sided subduction of the Longquanguan oceanic lithosphere resulted in distinct arc magmatism. Continental rift setting developed in the Hengshan, Huai'an and Zanhuang Complexes coevally. Finally, metamorphism associated with the similar to 1.85 Ga collision between the Western Block and the Eastern Block along the TNCO overprinted all the lithologies. The Paleoproterozoic continent building recorded in this study correlates with similar events in the crustal fragments of the Columbia supercontinent. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {The Jinchuan Ni-Cu deposit, which is the largest single magmatic sulfide ore deposit in the world, is hosted by a mafic-ultramafic intrusion in the Alxa block, northwestern China. The timing of amalgamation between the Alxa block and the adjacent Ordos block, which is important for Precambrian reconstruction of North China Craton and the search for another Jinchuan-type ore deposit, is contentious. The age distribution patterns of detrital zircon crystals with Precambrian ages from the Devonian and older sedimentary rocks of the Alxa and Ordos blocks are similar. This supports the traditional view that the Alxa and Ordos blocks were amalgamated in the Paleoproterozoic along the 1.95 Ga Khondalite Belt, long before the emplacement of the similar to 830 Ma Jinchuan intrusion. The U-Pb-Lu-Hf isotope data of comagmatic zircon crystals from the Jinchuan intrusion, together with its whole-rock Sm-Nd isotopes and trace element compositions given previously by other researchers, indicate that the Jinchuan ore-bearing intrusion is the product of continental rift-related basaltic magmatism which took place during the early stage of Rodinia breakup. Based on these observations, we conclude that in addition to the Alxa block, the adjacent regions in the North China Craton such as the Ordos basin, the Khondalite belt and the Yinshan terrane are most promising for new discoveries of Jinchuan-type Ni-Cu ore deposits.

   abstract = {The Junggar Basin, bounded by the West Junggar along late Carboniferous strike-slip faults in the west, is a post- orogenic successor basin within the Neoproterozoic to Paleozoic Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB). The Junggar Basin is a key region for understanding the Permian rifting processes since it is located in an extensional step-over zone between the Irtysh and North Tianshan strike-slip fault zones that were most active in the Permian. Based on new seismic reflection profiles, detrital petrology and zircon U-Pb ages, together with regional geological data and a refraction seismic profile, this study investigates the tectonic evolution and the geodynamic mechanics of the basin. The early Permian phase of synrift mechanical subsidence in the western Junggar Basin formed half grabens. Volcanic detritus is abundant, and detrital zircon U-Pb ages show sediment supply was entirely local. During the middle Permian post-rift phase with thermal subsidence, sediment supply exceeded subsidence, and there are increasingly distant sources of sediment. The Permian regional extensional stress field between major postaccretionary strike-slip fault zones triggered the reactivation of the pre-existing late Carboniferous strike-slip faults in West Junggar and produced thinning of the crust beneath the Junggar Basin, with a b crustal stretching factor of 1.74. Seismic refraction data reveals asthenospheric upwelling resulted in underplated mafic lower crust (6-10 km). The location of initial rift axis in the Junggar Basin was controlled by the juxtaposition of thin and weak crust beneath the basin and relatively strengthened thick crust in the West Junggar attributed to the cooling of A-type granites, resulting from localized strain. Similar location of post-orogenic rifting in southwestern CAOB, in areas of high heat flow following collision, suggests that Junggar Basin is an example of a more general process.

   abstract = {The Paleogene provenance of the Pearl River Mouth Basin in the northern South China Sea is poorly understood. In this paper, we present the first batch of zircon U-Pb and fission track double-dating ages of the Wenchang, Enping, and Zhuhai Formations in this basin. Together with data from previous provenance studies, the new dataset has been used to document the provenance shift during the Paleogene period. Characterized by a rather limited spectrum of both U-Pb and fission-track ages, the Eocene Wenchang Formation was probably mainly derived from intra-basinal uplifts. Multimodal distribution and large range of zircon ages of the Late Eocene-Early Oligocene Enping Formation is compatible with the age signatures of modern drainage sediments from the Southeastern Cathaysia Block. Age signatures of the Zhuhai Formation (Late Oligocene) and Enping Formation are indistinguishable, suggesting that they may have similar source areas and sediment provenance did not change dramatically during the Oligocene. Although variations in age patterns from the Wenchang Formation to the Enping-Zhuhai Formations imply a dominant provenance shift from local uplifts to the regional Cathaysia Block, it is difficult to exclude the influence of the local uplifts on sediments in the Enping-Zhuhai Formations.},

   abstract = {The Zoige depression is an important depocenter within the northeast Songpan-Ganzi flysch basin, which is bounded by the South China, North China and Qiangtang Blocks and forms the northeastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau. This paper discusses the sediment provenance and Mesozoic-Cenozoic evolution of the Zoige depression in the Songpan-Ganzi flysch basin, eastern Tibetan Plateau, using the detrital zircon U-Pb ages and apatite fission-track data from the Middle to Late Triassic sedimentary rocks in the area. The U-Pb ages of the Middle to Late Triassic zircons range from 260-280 Ma, 429-480 Ma, 792-974 Ma and 1800-2500 Ma and represent distinct source region. Our new results demonstrate that the detritus deposited during the Middle Triassic (Ladinian, T(2)zg) primarily originated from the Eastern Kunlun and North Qinling Orogens, with lesser contributions from the North China Block. By the Late Triassic (early Carnian, T(3)z), the materials at the southern margin of the North China Block were generally transported westward to the basin along a river network that flowed through the Qinling region between the North China and South China Blocks: this interpretation is supported by the predominance of the bimodal distribution of 1.8 Ga and 2.5 Ga age peaks and a lack of significant Neoproterozoic zircon. Since the Late Triassic (middle Carnian, T(3)zh), considerable changes have occurred in the source terranes, such as the cessation of the Eastern Kunlun Orogen and North China Block sources and the rise of the northwestern margin of the Yangtze Block and South Qinling Orogen. These drastic changes are compatible with a model of a sustained westward collision between the South China and North China Blocks during the late Triassic and the clockwise rotation of the South China Block progressively closed the basin. Subsequently, orogeny-associated folds have formed in the basin since the Late Triassic (late Carnian), and the study area was generally subjected to uplifting and cooling stages during 200-160 Ma, 90-120 Ma, 20-40 Ma and 10 Ma as evidenced by the apatite fission track data and the thermal history modeling. According to the regional background, we conclude that these stages are as follows, from oldest to youngest: the E-W extrusion across the entire Chinese mainland at the beginning of the Yanshanian period (200-160 Ma), the interaction among the North China, Yangtze and India plates during the Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous, the collision between the Indian and Eurasian plates since the Paleogene, and the rapid uplift simultaneous with the formation of the Tibetan Plateau since 10 Ma.},

   abstract = {The Zoige Depression is an important depocenter zone within the northeast of the Songpan-Ganzi Flysch Basin, which is bounded by the South China, North China, and Qiangtang blocks, and also forms the northeastern margin of Tibetan Plateau. This paper discusses the provenance of Middle to Late Triassic sedimentary rocks in the Zoige Depression using petrography, heavy mineral assemblages, and zircon U-Pb geochronology. The results demonstrate that the detritus is derived from multiple source regions. Four distinct parent rocks can be distinguished based on the heavy mineral assemblages and lithic fragments: Provenance 1 predominantly comprises intermediate-acidic volcanic rocks; Provenance 2 includes high-grade metamorphic rocks; Provenance 3 contains a mixture of various detrital components; and Provenance 4 primarily consists of mafic volcanic rocks. The different U-Pb ages of the zircons from the Middle to Late Triassic ranging from 260 to 280, 429-480, 792-974, and 1,800-2,500Ma represent distinct source regions, which are comparable to the 4 provenances mentioned above: Provenance 1 (260-280Ma), Eastern Kunlun Orogen; Provenance 2 (429-480 and/or 1,800-2,500Ma), Qinling orogeny (mainly in North Qinling); Provenance 3 (1,800-2,500Ma), the North China Block; and Provenance 4 (792-974Ma), the Yangtze Block. Overall, the detritus in the Middle Triassic (Ladinian, T(2)zg) primarily originates from the Eastern Kunlun Orogen and North Qinling. During the Late Triassic (Early Carnian, T(3)z), the southern margin of the North China Block was likely transported westward to the basin by a river network between the North China and South China blocks flowing through the Qinling region, because of the predominance of the detrital zircon age ranging from 1,800 to 2,500Ma and the occurrence of quartz sandstone with visible enlargement texture. Since the Late Triassic (Middle Carnian, T(3)zh), great changes have occurred in the source terrains, such as the absence of sources of the Eastern Kunlun Orogen and North China Block and the predominance of Yangtze Block. This drastic change can be explained by the Triassic collision between the South China and North China blocks, and the clockwise rotation of the South China Block progressively closed the basin and uplifted the Qinling orogeny.},

   abstract = {The northern Alxa Block occupies a key position in the southern margin of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB) and records late Paleozoic subduction and closure processes of the Paleo-Asian Ocean (PAO). However, there are still controversies regarding the timing and location of the final closure of the PAO. This study presents structural deformation data and geochronological and geochemical data for Permian volcanic rocks, as well as detrital zircon provenance analysis of Permian sedimentary rocks along the Nuoergong-Langshan Zone (NLZ) in the northern Alxa Block. During the early to middle Permian, the PAO lithospheric slab subducted beneath the northern Alxa Block, rendering a continental volcanic arc in the NLZ and also giving rise to extensive folding, thrusting, and crustal thickening. The crustal thickening in the NLZ may trigger the early Permian magmatic flare-up that constructed much of the continental arc plutons. In the middle to late Permian, a retroarc foreland basin was formed, within which the Dahongshan Formation deposited. Significant active tectonic movements led to regional unconformity occurring during this period. A large-scale dextral ductile shear deformation in the NLZ resulting from the lateral extrusion of the thickened crust after the terminal amalgamation of the southern CAOB was constrained between 272 and 249 Ma, suggesting a late Permian tectonic transition from compression to transpression. Combining these findings with published data, we suggest that the final consumption of the PAO occurred in the late Permian, probably along the Enger Us suture zone in the northern margin Alxa Block.},

   abstract = {The origin and the Precambrian tectonic evolution of the Alxa Block have not been well studied, largely due to widespread desert coverage and a lack of high-resolution geochronological data. This paper reports zircon U-Pb ages and Hf isotopic data for the Langshan Group in the northeastern Alxa Block. Detrital zircons from the Langshan Group mainly provide U-Pb ages between ca. 2000Ma and 1100Ma, suggesting that their provenance was dominated by late Palaeoproterozoic to Mesoproterozoic rocks, which yield two main peak ages at 1592Ma and 1745Ma. These zircons possess epsilon Hf (t) values between -15 and +8, implying the derivation of their precursor magmas from old crust and juvenile materials. Zircon U-Pb dating yields ages of 898 +/- 4Ma and 808 +/- 4Ma for the granite cobbles in coarse conglomerate in the Fourth Formation and the diorite intruding into the Second Formation of the Langshan Group, which constrains the depositional age of the main part of the Langshan Group to between 898 and 804Ma. Our data show that the Langshan Group was probably deposited in an intra-continental rift basin and originated from recycled orogens. The geochronology and palaeocurrent data indicate that the North China Craton (NCC) could not have provided source materials for the Langshan Group. Instead, the Langshan Group shares a similar origin and detrital zircon age spectrum with the Beishan Complex in the South Beishan Collage. Combining these findings with published data, we propose that the Alxa Block was not a part of the NCC during the Neoproterozoic but a Precambrian micro-continent block. The Alxa Block recorded footprints that are related to the late amalgamation of the Rodinia supercontinent and the initial breakup. We suggest that the Alxa Block laid between Australia and Laurentia in the Rodinia supercontinent during the Neoproterozoic.},

   abstract = {The Yidun terrane is located between the Qiangtang terrane and Songpan-Ganzi Fold Belt and its tectonic affinity with other adjacent terrane is of significance to understand the tectonic evolution of southeastern Tibetan Plateau. In this study, we present integrated bulk geochemical data, detrital zircon U-Pb ages and Hf isotopes of meta-sedimentary rocks from the Qiasi Group, which represents the oldest Precambrian basement of the Yidun terrane, to constrain the depositional age and provenance of the meta-sedimentary rocks as well as the tectonic affinity of the terrane. Zircon U-Pb dating results show that detrital zircons from three samples have almost identical age spectra with two major age clusters of 800-780 Ma and 850-820 Ma at age peaks of ca. 790 Ma and ca. 827 Ma, and one minor age cluster of 910-860 Ma. The youngest group of detrital zircons reveals that the maximum depositional age of the Qiasi Group was 779-777 Ma. Low SiO2/Al(2)O3 (2.9-4.1), CIA (59-47), and PIA (63-47) values indicate that the sediments could be derived mainly from the low mature sources that had undergone weak to mildly moderate degree of chemical weathering. Bulk geochemical and zircon U-Pb-Hf isotopic data suggest that the provenance was composed mainly of Neoproterozoic intermediate to felsic igneous rocks. In combination with the published geological data and detrital zircon U-Pb age spectra on the western Yangtze Block, and the Kunlun-Qilian-Qaidam Block, we propose that the Neoproterozoic basement of the Yidun terrane has a close tectonic affinity with the former one.},

   abstract = {The pre-collisional sedimentary provenance of southern Taiwan not only can offer important information about the paleogeography of the region prior to the Taiwan orogeny, but may also provide significant constraint for understanding the origin of the Central Range of Taiwan and the history of the orogen. Although there have been previous studies on sedimentary provenance of the Hengchun Peninsula, the southernmost part of the Taiwan mountain belt, these studies appear to have limited sample coverage. Therefore, we performed detrital zircon U-Pb geochronology and hafnium isotopic analysis of samples covering all three Mid-Late Miocene stratigraphic units of the peninsula. Our results suggest that, whereas the Minjiang (Min River) and the Jiulongjiang (Jiulong River) in SE China are the primary sediment sources for the Shihmen and Lilungshan Formations, the Loshui Formation was likely deposited in a deep sea fan originated from a rifted continental fragment in the south. The developing accretionary prism and proto-Taiwan may have also provided sediments to the area. The proposed presence of a continental fragment that provided sediments in the Loshui Formation supports the hypothesis that the Taiwan orogen may have formed as a double collision that incorporated not only the Luzon Arc and the Eurasian continental margin, but also rifted continental blocks in between.},

The age distributions yield dominant Neoarchean (similar to 25 Ga), Mesoproterozoic (1.7-1.4 Ga), Grenvillian (similar to 0.95 Ga), and Pan-African (0.65-0.5 Ga) age groups and minor Paleo- to Meso-archean zircons. Hf isotope compositions of zircons for each age group exhibit large ranges of epsilon Hf-(T), suggesting that the zircon host rocks have diverse sources. The oldest Hf model ages for zircons of Neoarchean, Grenvillian, and Pan-African age group yield similar to 3.7 Ga or older, while those of Mesoproterozoic age group show similar to 33 Ga. The remarkable similarity of age distribution and Hf isotope compositions among detrital zircons of Indochina and those of Tethyan Himalaya, western Cathaysia, and Qiangtang suggests that Indochina was located outboard of Qiangtang and south of South China in the Indian margin of Gondwana during the Early Paleozoic.

The varying detrital zircon spectral patterns analyzed from the Paleogene Jaintia, Barail and Neogene Surma and Tipam Groups, with sediment petrography, track source sediment derived from cratonic India, Gangdese and eastern Transhimalayan batholiths and the eastern Himalaya. These sources are tested against Cenozoic paleopositions proposed for the northeastward motion of the Indian plate. Precollisional cratonic detritus to Middle to Late Eocene Sylhet Formation shifted to Tethyan Himalaya and arc sources of the Gangdese and eastern Transhimalayan batholiths to Late Eocene Kopili and Barail Formations, consistent with the proposed paleoposition proximal to the Indus-Yarlung suture. This Sylhet-Kopili Formation transition, within the Jaintia Group, reflects one of the earliest Himalayan hinterland exhumation stages during the Late Eocene. Major shift in provenance to Higher Himalayan Crystalline and arc detritus is recorded from the Surma Group, constraining Mid Miocene Himalayan tectonic exhumation from the eastern Himalaya. Late Miocene Tipam Group preserves sediment of Higher Himalayan Crystalline detritus, ophiolite and likely Lesser Himalayan rocks. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {The Dras Arc in NW India Himalaya is a belt of basaltic-andesites intercalated with arkose-dominated volcaniclastic rocks of the Nindam Formation situated along the Indus Suture between India and Eurasia. Debates exist as to whether these rocks developed in a forearc basin to the Eurasian margin or as part of an intraoceanic island arc system that collided with either India or Eurasia before final continental collision. Detrital zircons from the Nindam Formation yield U-Pb age spectra with dominant youngest age populations of similar to 84-125 Ma, corresponding with arc magmatism. Sandstone provenance analysis from the Nindam Formation indicates that the Dras Arc evolved from an undissected arc to dissected arc over a period of similar to 41 Myr. Slightly older, smaller populations occur at similar to 135-185 Ma, corresponding with reported ages of Neotethyan ophiolites (e.g., Spongtang). The basal section of the Nindam Formation reveals the presence of arc-derived basaltic-andesite and tonalite clasts, plus ophiolitic components sourced from an adjacent accretionary complex. There is a distinct absence of quartz or felsic granitic clasts, suggesting that the Nindam Formation did not develop as a forearc basin to the Ladakh Batholith of southern Eurasia but rather as separate intraoceanic island arc. A distinct "Gondwanan" signature occurs in all samples, with zircon age peaks at similar to 514-988, similar to 1000-1588, similar to 1627-2444, and similar to 2500 Ma. We suggest that the Dras and Spong arcs are the same intraoceanic island arc system that developed as a result of subduction initiation along NNE-SSW transform faults perpendicular to the Indian and Eurasia continents.},

   abstract = {The Great Unconformity between the Precambrian basement rock and Cambrian sedimentary cover has been extensively documented in Laurentia and may provide insights into the environmental context of the Cambrian explosion. A similar unconformity has been known in the North China Craton (NCC) and it offers an opportunity to constrain the geographic extent and geochronological magnitude of the Great Unconformity. However, the placement and magnitude of the Great Unconformity in the NCC, particularly at the southeastern margin of the NCC, is uncertain. For example, in the Huaibei region of the southeastern margin of the NCC, this unconformity has been variously placed beneath or above the Gouhou Formation, which preserves critical micro- and macrofossil assemblages with great paleobiological and biostratigraphic significance. This uncertainty significantly hampers our ability to fully appreciate the geological history of the NCC. To resolve this issue, we carried out an integrated biostratigraphic, sedimentary petrological and detrital zircon geochronological investigation on the Gouhou Formation and the overlying Houjiashan Formation in the Huaibei region. Our data suggest that the Great Unconformity lies within the Gouhou Formation and represents a ca. 200-300 Myr depositional gap: the Lower Member of the Gouhou Formation is of Tonian age whereas the Middle-Upper members of the Gouhou Formation are of early Cambrian. Therefore, we propose that the Gouhou Formation be redefined to contain only the Lower Member, and the Middle-Upper members be included in the Houjiashan Formation. Our analysis also confirms that the Great Unconformity can be widely recognized along the southeastern margin of the NCC. The recognition of the Great Unconformity in the Huaibei region helps to clarify the tectonic history, basin development, stratigraphic correlation, and paleogeographic reconstruction of the southeastern margin of the NCC during the Tonian-Cambrian periods.},

   abstract = {The North China Craton (NCC) was subjected to an extensional regime after the Luliang movement at similar to 1.8 Ga and then was covered by an extensive Meso- to Neoproterozoic sedimentary succession, namely the Changcheng, Jixian and Qingbaikou Groups in ascending order. We report age spectra for detrital zircons and monazites, Hf isotopic systematics of detrital zircons, and whole-rock chemical and Nd isotopic compositions for sediments from the succession in the Ming Tombs area, Beijing, one of the typical Meso- to Neoproterozoic areas in the NCC. Detrital zircons of six sedimentary samples have two distinct age peaks at similar to 2.52 Ga and similar to 1.85 Ga. There are some detrital zircons at 2.4-2.0 Ga but none at 2.3 Ga and only a few >2.7 Ga. The detrital zircon age spectra change with time. Sediments in the lower succession (Changcheng Group) and in the upper successions (Jixian and Qinbaikou Groups) are dominated by significant detrital zircon populations of late Neoarchean and late Paleoproterozoic ages, respectively. The similar to 2.5 Ga detrital zircons of the Changcheng Group have epsilon(Hf)(2.5 Ga) values and t(DM)(Hf) model ages mainly ranging from -2 to +7 and 2.8 to 2.7 Ga, respectively. Detrital monazites of a sample from the Jixian Group exhibit a major age peak between 1.95 and 1.80 Ga with some data between 2.0 and 1.95 Ga. The sedimentary rocks of the Changcheng Group are characterized by high K2O contents (mostly 7.09-15.20%) and insignificant Eu anomalies (Eu/Eu* = 0.71-1.16). They have t(DM)(Nd) model ages ranging from 2.70 to 2.43 Ga, being older than the t(DM)(Nd) ages (2.11 and 1.99 Ga) of sedimentary samples from the Qingbaikou Group. Based on a comparison with ages for the early Precambrian (>1.8 Ga) basement of the NCC, it can be concluded that (1) the sediments of the Meso- to Neoproterozoic cover were undoubtedly derived from the NCC itself or once neighboring terranes; (2) variations in the detrital zircon age spectra from the lower to the upper successions reflect provenance evolution in that the lower crustal late Paleoproterozoic rocks were exposed at the surface after the upper crustal late Neoarchean rocks had already been eroded.

   abstract = {Mesozoic sedimentary units within the Nanzhao and Mashiping basins record the paleogeographic and tectonic evolution of the Qinling Orogen (QO). This study uses new detrital zircon U-Pb ages and Hf isotopic data to constrain the timing of deposition and provenance of the Taishanmiao, Taizishan, Nanzhao, and Mashiping formations of the North Qinling Orogen (NQO). The detrital zircons can be split by age peaks into five major groups, including Early Cretaceous, Late Triassic, Early Paleozoic, Neoproterozoic and Paleoproterozoic age peaks. On the basis of the youngest zircon ages and age-diagnostic fossils, we conclude that the Taishanmiao (youngest age of 234 Ma) and Taizishan (216 Ma) formations were deposited during the Late Triassic, whereas the Nanzhao Formation (110 Ma) was deposited during the Early Cretaceous rather than the Late Jurassic as previously thought. TheMashiping Formation (110 Ma) was also deposited during the Early Cretaceous. Combinedwith zirconHf isotopic compositions, zircons from Late Triassic units were generally derived from the NQO, South Qinling Orogen (SQO), and North China Craton (NCC), with minor amounts derived from the Xing-Meng Orogenic Belt. The sediments within the Nanzhao Formation were mainly derived from the QO, with aminor contribution from the NCC. The Early Cretaceous conglomerates of the Mashiping Formation were generally derived from recycled earlier detritus. This implies that Late Triassic deposition was related to the final closure of the Mianlue Ocean, whereas Early Cretaceous deposition was correlated to the continued intercontinental subduction of the Yangtze Craton beneath the QO. The change in provenance within these Mesozoic sediments suggests the QO underwent two periods of significant uplift, which was a process generated sediments that were deposited in a series of basins of this area.

   abstract = {The Ganjiang River, one of eight major tributaries of the Yangtze River, located in the western hinterland of the Cathaysia Block, SE China, has a length of 823 km and a drainage area of 82 809 km(2), whose detrital zircons provide a valuable means to trace sediment provenances of the river and explore the crustal growth and evolution of the Cathaysia Block. In the current study, 389 concordia zircon U-Pb age spots and rare earth element (REE) contents, in combination with 201 Lu-Hf isotope analyses, have been determined. Oscillatory zoning, high Th/U ratios and REE distribution patterns indicate that most detrital zircon grains are of magmatic origin. The age can be further divided into seven groups: 130-185 Ma with a peak at 153 Ma (7 %); 217-379 Ma with a peak at 224 Ma (16 %); 390-494 Ma with a peak at 424 Ma (37 %); 500-698 Ma with a peak at 624 Ma (5 %); 716-897 Ma with a peak at 812 Ma (10 %); 902-1191 Ma with a peak at 976 Ma (13 %); and 2232-2614 Ma with a peak at 2471 Ma (5 %). The sources of almost all the zircon age groups can be found from the exposed rocks. In particular, Yanshanian, Hercynian to Indosinian, Pan-African, Grenvillian and Palaeoproterozoic-Archaean zircons can be mainly sourced from the northern Guangdong - southern Jiangxi - western Fujian region, while Caledonian zircons come from southern and central Jiangxi, and Jinningian zircons are from central and northern Jiangxi. Most determined zircon grains exhibit negative epsilon(Hf)(t) values and T-DM2 ages of 797 to 4016 Ma with a wide peak at 1500-2100 Ma and a keen peak at 1824 Ma, suggesting that most zircons are sourced from the reworked ancient crustal materials or crust-mantle mixing. The zircon Hf model age cumulative probability diagram shows that rapid crustal growth took place at the Palaeo- to Mesoproterozoic and that about 90 % of the crust of the Cathaysia Block was formed before 1.5 Ga.},

Detrital zircons in quartz sandstone drillcore from the Benxi Formation are euhedral-subhedral, oscillatory zoned, and have high Th/U ratios (0.03-1.60, generally greater than 0.3) that are indicative of a magmatic origin. Detrital zircons from samples 13H16A and 13H16B yield seven (2544, 1788, 1123, 955, 737, 441, and 344 Ma) and six main age populations (2440, 1583, 951, 759, 434, and 348 Ma), respectively. The epsilon(Hf)(t) values of the Neoarchean-Paleoproterozoic zircons range from -11.3 to +13.9, and these zircons have delta O-18 values that range from 5.68 parts per thousand to 8.83 parts per thousand. The Neoproterozoic zircons have variable epsilon(Hf)(t) (-9.2 to +12.5) and delta O-18 (5.58 parts per thousand to 9.85 parts per thousand) values, whereas the Palaeozoic zircons have epsilon(Hf)(t) values between -19.9 and +13.4 and delta O-18 values of 5.23 parts per thousand-9.43 parts per thousand. The Benxi Formation was deposited during the late Carboniferous and contains sediments derived from igneous rocks of the North Qinling Orogen combined with a small amount of material derived from Precambrian basement of the NCC. The northward subduction of the South Qinling Orogen caused the uplift and erosion of the North Qinling Orogen during the late Carboniferous.},

   abstract = {The Dajianggang Formation is located in the Changchun-Yanji suture zone of central Jilin Province and unconformably overlies the Changchun-Yanji Accretionary Complex (CYAC), which is a melange resulting from subduction of the Jiamusi-Khanka Block (JKB) beneath the North China Craton (NCC). LA-MC-ICP-MS U-Pb dating of detrital zircon from four samples of the formation yields ages of 2516 to 216 Ma. Zircons with U-Pb ages at 2516-2501 Ma and 1897-1832 Ma indicate a provenance from Precambrian basement rocks of the NCC. The 525-482 Ma ages indicate a 'provenance from metamorphic rocks of Late Pan-African age in the JKB that have a tectonic affinity to the Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB). Zircon grains with ages of 383-314 Ma and 275-250 Ma were likely derived from the underlying CYAC. The youngest population has a peak age of ca. 225 Ma, which together with Late Triassic fossils, suggests that deposition of the Dajianggang Formation was Late Triassic or younger. This result supports the view that the final collision of the JKB and NCC along the Changchun-Yanji suture took place before the Late Triassic. Furthermore, this closure time is at least 10-20 Ma later than closure along the Solonker-Xar Moron-Changchun suture in the Late Permian. We thus establish that the Changchun-Yanji suture is not related to the collision between the Siberia Craton (SC) and the NCC but was instead related to the Paleo-Pacific plate subduction. Consequently, the Changchun-Yanji suture is not the eastward extension of the Solonker-Xar Moron-Changchun suture as previously considered, but the southern margin of the Jilin-Heilongjiang high-pressure metamorphic belt (Ji-Hei HP belt), and resulted from westward subduction of the Paleo-Pacific Ocean. Thus, the Late Triassic marked the switch in subduction from the Paleo-Asian Ocean to the Paleo-Pacific Ocean in NE China. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Eastern Tibet to the west of the Yangtze Block consists of the Yidun and Songpan-Ganzi Terranes, separated by the Ganzi-Litang suture zone. The Yidun Terrane includes the Zhongza Massif to the west, but the eastern part of the Yidun terrane is covered by the Yidun Group extending from the south (Shangri-La region) to the north (Changtai region). The Yidun Group, from the base upward, includes the Lieyi, Qugasi, Tumugou and Lanashan formations, which are mainly composed of volcanic-flysch successions. Based on the ages of volcanic interlayers and plutonic intrusions, depositional ages of the Qugasi and Tumugou formations are considered to be slightly older than 230 Ma and ca. 220-230 Ma respectively, which are prominently older than the previous estimates. The Yidun Group in the Changtai region has two prominent detrital zircon age peaks at 400-480 and 880-980 Ma and a minor peak at 2.45-2.50 Ga. This pattern suggests a detritus source from the Zhongza Massif, which was a micro-continent separated from the western Yangtze Block. In contrast the Yidun Group in the Shangri-La region has various zircon age spectra among different formations. The Qugasi Formation in this region has detrital zircon age patterns similar to the Yidun Group in the Changtai region. However, the overlying Tumugou Formation shows distinct age peaks at Triassic (220-240 Ma), Neoproterozoic (similar to 720-880 Ma), and Paleoproterozoic (similar to 1.75-1.90 Ga). This age pattern is similar to that of the Xikang Group of the Songpan-Ganzi Terrane to the east The detrital zircon age difference between the Qugasi and Tumugou formations in this region indicates a transition of sedimentary sources from the Zhongza Massif to locally distributed Triassic magmatic rocks at similar to 230 Ma. It is thus suggested that the Songpan-Ganzi Terrane may have been connected to or collided with the southern part of the Yidun Terrane during the Late Triassic, whereas the Songpan-Ganzi Terrane and the northern part of the Yidun Terrane were still separated by the Ganzi-Litang Ocean.

   abstract = {The Solonker Suture Zone was formed during the closure process of the Paleo-Asian Ocean (PAO). In order to better constrain its tectonic setting and evolution history in the Late Carboniferous-Early Permian, we conducted an integrated study of the Shoushangou Formation in the central Inner Mongolia, involving the sedimentological features, depositional age, and detrital zircon populations. Our results indicate that the Shoushangou Formation was deposited in ca. 320-280 Ma, overlain by the Dashizhai Formation with ages of ca. 280-274 Ma, and the 330- to 280-Ma detrital age data almost serve as the entire age component of this formation. Also, its stratigraphic reconstruction shows a coarsening-upward marine sequence upwards, which is characterized by sandstone turbidites with a Bouma sequence and the numerous tuff involvements in the lower strata, showing a deep marine environment and synchronous volcanism. Integrating previous data and our results, with a gradually deepening water depth and a geographic variation, detrital zircon age spectra from the Late Carboniferous-Early Permian sequence show distinct differences, and a marked shift of multiple resources to a single source occurred in the Late Carboniferous-Early Permian. These clues suggest an active marginal setting and a northward-dipping subduction during this period in the north side of the PAO, and we further attribute such a source variation to the spreading of a marine back-arc basin after the amalgamation of the Uliastai Active Continental Margin with the Northern Accretionary Orogen. The Shoushangou Formation was the direct depositional response to such a back-arc basin.},

   abstract = {The Yinggehai-Song Hong Basin has received a large amount of terrigenous sediment from different continental blocks since the Paleogene. The Yingdong slope, which is located on the eastern side of this basin, is an important potential gas province, but the provenance of the marine sediments in this area are poorly understood. The detrital zircon U-Pb geochronology of sedimentary rocks from the lower Miocene to Quaternary is examined in this study to investigate the temporal and spatial variations in provenance since the early Miocene. The U-Pb ages of detrital zircon range from 3078 to 30 Ma, suggesting that sediment input is derived from multiple sources. Detailed analyses of these components indicate that both the Red River and Hainan are likely the major sources of the sediments on the Yingdong slope, with additional minor contributions from central Vietnam (eastern Indochina block) and possibly the Songpan-Garze block. Variations in the dominant detrital zircon populations within strati-graphic successions display an increasing contribution from the Red River since the middle Miocene. This resulted from the progradation of the Red River Delta in the northern basin and may have also been influenced by regional surface uplift and associated climate changes in East Asia. This study shows that the Red River has had a relatively stable provenance since at least the early Miocene, indicating that any large-scale drainage capture of the Red River should have occurred before circa 23 Ma.},

   abstract = {Cenozoic sedimentary strata of the continental margin are well preserved in ocean basins and offer an important geological window for studying source-to-sink relationships between potential source areas and sedimentary basins over time. We conducted coupled U-Pb dating and Lu-Hf isotope analysis of detrital zircon in fluvial sediments along northern and central Vietnam and sediment core in the western Yinggehai-Song Hong Basin in order to characterize the potential sources, investigate the sedimentary provenance, and decipher the crustal evolution processes of the source areas. The detrital zircons from the fluvial sediments reveal marked spatial changes in their age signatures that correlate with changing basement characteristics. The Red River system generally has multiple zircon age populations with peaks at ca. 30-25 Ma, 247-239 Ma, 441-414 Ma, 751-743 Ma, 1876-1742 Ma, and 2700-2200 Ma, in contrast to the sediments from central Vietnam, which commonly exhibit markedly different age patterns with well-defined Silurian and Triassic peaks (ca. 244-234 Ma and 438-419 Ma). The source-to-sink study demonstrates that both the Red River and central Vietnam materials have made important provenance contributions to the western Yinggehai-Song Hong Basin since the middle Miocene. The western basin has had constantly changing provenance since the middle Miocene because the contributions from these two source areas vary temporally. This integrated study also indicates that the southern Yangtze block and eastern Indochina block had a significantly different tectonic evolution history, as manifested by the age populations of major tectonic-magmatic events. Juvenile crustal growth occurred in the southern Yangtze block during the Neoproterozoic and late Paleozoic to Mesozoic, while the eastern Indochina block is characterized by prominent crustal additions in the Paleoproterozoic.},

U-Pb age data for 936 detrital zircons from eleven sedimentary rock samples from the Meishan Formation (Langhian-Serravallian) range in age from 3252 Ma to 28 Ma and suggests input from multiple sources. The provenance of the sediments changes from one part of the basin to another. The sedimentary rocks located on northern and western Yinggehai-Song Hong Basin generally have multiple detrital zircon age populations and a wide range ages, suggesting consistent with derivation from the Red River. By contrast, the zircon ages from eastern side of the basin generally show bimodal detrital zircon age populations consisting of ca. 98 Ma and 241 Ma components, which suggest that these sandstones were derived locally from Hainan. Comparison of the age populations and heavy mineral assemblages with the potential sources terrains indicates that both southern Yangtze Block and Hainan Uplift contributed the clastic material to the basin during middle Miocene. The majority of clastic material was supplied from the northwest and east through the "Red River delta" and other deltas near to the western Hainan, respectively. Heavy mineral assemblages and zircon ages also reveal that small amounts of sediment were shed westwards from the Indochina Block. Moreover, no significant change is indicated between the Upper and Lower Meishan Formation by zircon U-Pb ages and heavy mineral data suggesting that the Yinggehai-Song Hong Basin sources were similar throughout the middle Miocene.

Zircon U-Pb LA-ICP-MS dating of chlorite quartz schist and tuff that form the Ailiankate Group and Sailajiazitage Group have yielded age peaks at 780 and 787 Ma, respectively. These data indicate that the Ailiankate and Sailajiazitage groups are Neoproterozoic succession deposited at ca. 740-790 Ma. Those strata are temporally equivalent and are likely parts of a single wide spread succession and reflect a rifting process related to the break-up of the Rodinia supercontinent. In situ zircon Hf isotopic data from Sailajiazitage Group show that older zircons (similar to 1 994 Ma) have crustal model ages of 2 272-2 784 Ma, suggesting an ancient crustal growth and reworking. The similar to 787 Ma zircons have similar to 2 000 Ma crustal model ages, suggesting derivations from recycled Paleoproterozoic material.},

   abstract = {The Tiekelik Belt includes a large outcrop area of Precambrian continental crust, which is exposed along the southwestern margin of the Tarim Craton, NW China. It is characterized by the occurrence of highgrade metamorphic rocks and volcano-sedimentary successions. In this contribution, we present zircon U-Pb results from 10 samples of rocks from these volcano-sedimentary successions for provenance and age determinations, and geochemical analyses on basalts of the bimodal volcanic rocks from the Sailajiazitage Group. Four schist and paragneiss samples from the Ailiankate Group contain numerous zircons with ages of 650-850 Ma, suggesting that this group was deposited after the late Neoproterozoic and is not part of the Paleoproterozoic crystalline basement of the Tarim Craton as previously believed. One sample collected from marble of the Bochatetage Formation suggests a depositional age below 773 Ma. Three sandstone samples from the Sukuluoke and Qiakemaklike formations contain zircon ranging in ages from 630 Ma to 830 Ma, suggesting deposition of these formations after the Ediacaran. One andesite clast from the Qiakemaklike conglomerate gave a (206)pb/U-238 age of 793 +/- 5 Ma, while a rhyolite from the Sailajiazitage Group gave a Pb-206/U-238 age of 881 +/- 6 Ma. The basalts of the bimodal volcanic rocks from the Sailajiazitage Group show enrichment of light rare earth elements (La-N/Yb-N =4.92-8.51) and high field strength elements (HFSE) (e.g. Nb, Zr and Ti), similar to continental flood basalts (CFB), indicating bimodal volcanism in a within-plate tectonic setting. Our new data, combined with previous sedimentary facies analysis, suggest the presence of a large Neoproterozoic volcano-sedimentary rift basin. This rift basin records the change from a fluviolacustrine to a marine environment along the southwestern margin of the Tarim Craton. The zircon U-Pb ages indicate initial rifting at 880 Ma, followed by extensive rifting at similar to 790 Ma. The detrital zircons of the Tiekelik Belt are dominated by four populations of Neoproterozoic (630-670 Ma, ca. 740-745 Ma, ca. 785 Ma, and ca. 800-850 Ma), with some Paleoproterozoic and Archean grains (2800-1800 Ma). The major detrital zircon populations approximately match the ages of widespread magmatism documented along the northern margin of the Tarim Craton. We consider that sourcing of these components from the northern Tarim could explain the age probability patterns of the Tiekelik Neoproterozoic sediments. We speculate that this process might be linked to far-field tectonics causing uplift and erosion of the northern Tarim rocks and predominantly large-scale southwards transport of sediments over the craton. The rifting environment of the sedimentary basin in the Tiekelik Belt, however, suggests a bidirectional source. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {The Altyn Complex in Altyn Tagh, NW China is commonly considered as the Archean-Paleoproterozoic basement of the Tarim craton. It consists predominantly of mafic and felsic orthogneisses and metasedimentary rocks. Seven samples for laser ablation ICP-MS U-Pb zircon dating were collected from felsic orthogneisses, granites, paragneisses and leucosomes within the Altyn Complex that are exposed at Jianggalesayi and Danshuiquan in the west, at Bashiwake in the middle, and at Yaganbuyang in the east of South Altyn. Our results indicate that both granite and orthogneisses were emplaced at 900-940 Ma, containing inherited zircon cores ranging in age from similar to 1100 Ma to 1800 Ma. Zircons in the orthogneisses have metamorphic rims that yielded ages clustered from 454 to 508 Ma. The paragneiss from Yaganbuyang yielded an estimated maximum depositional age of 835 +/- 10 Ma and a metamorphic age of 458 +/- 6 Ma, and most detrital zircons were dated at 835-1864 Ma. The paragneiss from Bashiwake yielded an estimated maximum depositional age of 1362 18 Ma and a metamorphic age of 907 14 Ma, and most detrital zircons were dated at 1150-1630 Ma. A leucosome from migmatite in Jianggalesayi yielded a metamorphic age of 417 +/- 2 Ma, with detrital cores dated at similar to 1073-1789 Ma. Integrated with the previous U-Pb zircon geochronological data, we propose that the Altyn Complex is not the Archean-Paleoproterozoic crystallized basement of the Tarim craton as previously believed. We suggest that these granitoids magmatism and precursors of metasedimentary units in the Altyn Complex were produced at an active margin outside of the Tarim craton during early Neoproterozoic time. Early Palaeozoic multistage metamorphic ages (ca. 485-510 Ma, ca. 454-458 Ma and ca. 417 Ma) in the Altyn Complex, overlap the main phases of the South Altyn granitic rocks (ca. 500-410 Ma), indicating that this complex developed during the early Palaeozoic collisional orogeny in the Altyn Tagh. Based on a combination of Grenville-age detritus and the record of late Neoproterozoic extensional tectono-thermal activity, we place the Altyn Complex on the margin of a Grenville-age orogen which represents part of the juxtaposition of continental masses within the Rodinia Supercontinent. The similarity in age of magmatism and metamorphism in the Altyn Tagh-North Qaidam-Qilian-East Kunlun suggest the existence of an early Neoproterozoic active continental margin system along the northeastern margin of Tibetan Plateau.

   abstract = {The Oligocene Zhuhai Formation has been proven to be one of the main reservoirs in the Pearl River Mouth Basin in the northern South China Sea but its sedimentary provenance remains uncertain and controversial. Here we conducted a systematic study by U-Pb analysis of detrital zircon of the Zhuhai Formation in order to identify the source terrane, investigate the sedimentary source, and establish the framework for the provenance variation during the Oligocene. The study suggests that the detrital zircon in the different structural units reveal marked spatial differences in their age compositions that correlate with the changing sources. The western and eastern parts of the basin have a significantly different provenance manifested by the age compositions of the detrital sediments. The western basin generally has a relatively complex age spectrum and is characterized by a multi-peak distribution, suggesting that the main source was derived from the southern margin of the South China Block. In contrast, the eastern basin displays a dominant population ranging from 131 to 142 Ma, which implies that the sediments were mainly eroded from a nearby source. Our data demonstrate that the Cathaysia Block hinterland and the intrabasinal sources provided dominant provenance contributions to the Pearl River Mouth Basin during the Oligocene. Additionally, Hainan Island and Central Vietnam (eastern Indochina Block) do not appear to have been important sources, whereas Luzon Island and northern Palawan probably provided negligible contributions to the basin during the same time period.},

The lower Miocene is an important stratigraphic unit for deciphering sediment evolution in the continental shelf of the northwestern South China Sea, but the provenance characteristics of this strata remain unclear. In this study, detrital zircon U-Pb geochronology and Lu-Hf isotopes from the lower Miocene Sanya Formation in the Yinggehai-Song Hong Basin were examined to study the provenance and its variation in the early Miocene. U-Pb dating of detrital zircons yielded ages ranging from Archean to Cenozoic (3313 to 39 Ma) and displayed age distributions with multiple peaks and a wide range of epsilon(Hf)(t) values (from -27.2 to +8.5). Multi-proxy sediment provenance analysis indicates that the Red River system was the major source for the sediments in the northern basin, with additional contribution from central Vietnam, and the Hainan played the most important role in contributing detritus to the eastern margin of the basin in the middle Miocene. This paper highlights the provenance of early Miocene sediments and contributes to paleogeographic reconstruction and reservoir evaluation.},

   abstract = {A sequence of Paleoproterozoic meta-supracrustal rocks, known as the "Guanghua Group", is exposed to the north of Tonghua City, Jilin Province, China. The composition and ages of formation and metamorphism of the protolith, and the tectonic petrogenesis of the Guanghua Group are poorly understood. Comprehending these rocks are important in constraining the formation and evolutionary history of the northern segment of the Paleoproterozoic Jiao-Liao-Ji Belt. We have studied the petrology and geochemistry of these meta-supracrustal rocks, revealing that the protoliths can be sub-divided into two groups: metavolcanic and metasedimentary rocks. The metavolcanic rocks are mainly amphibolite, biotite-bearing plagiogneiss, and minor biotite leptynites, whose protoliths were basaltic andesite, andesite, and minor rhyolite with both calc-alkaline and tholeiite affinities. Petrogenetic studies indicate that the intermediate-basic rocks were derived from a depleted lithospheric mantle wedge that was metasomatized by slab-derived fluids or melts. The metasedimentary rocks consist of biotite quartz schist and staurolite-bearing garnet-muscovite schist, together with minor biotite-bearing plagiogneiss and biotite leptynites, with protoliths mainly comprising mudstone with subordinate sandstone and greywacke. The structure, composition, and U-Pb ages of zircon indicate that the protoliths of the metavolcanic and metasedimentary rocks formed at ca. 2.18 Ga and 2.03 Ga, respectively, and were modified by two stages of metamorphism at ca. 1.90 and 1.85 Ga. The protoliths of the metasedimentary rocks were derived mainly from mid-Paleoproterozoic granites, with minor contributions from coeval metabasic rocks and Archean granitic rocks. Based on these findings and existing regional data, we suggest that: (i) the Paleoproterozoic supracrustal rocks of the Guanghua Group are comparable with the Laoling Group in their age of formation, composition, and petrogenesis, and were the products of the same geological event; meaning that rocks of the Guanghua Group should be considered as part of the Laoling Group; (ii) the metabasic and metasedimentary rocks formed in a back-arc basin setting; and (iii) the pre-mid-Paleoproterozoic formation and evolution of the northern segment of the Jiao-Liao-Ji Belt were related to arc continent collision.},

U-Pb dating results suggest that the maximum depositional ages for the Luojiamen, Baizhu and Xiuning Formations are 863 +/- 10 Ma, 826 +/- 7 Ma and 763 +/- 10 Ma, respectively. One zircon grain from the Baizhu Formation gives a concordant U-Pb age at 3918 +/- 32 Ma, with Hf model age of ca. 4290 Ma, indicating Hadean crust growth in its source. The integrated U-Pb ages and Hf-isotopes in zircons from each formation show different crustal evolution in their source areas. The Luojiamen detrital zircons in the eastern JO are all of Early Neoproterozoic (ca. 965-855 Ma) with positive epsilon(Hf)(t) (+6 to +15), suggesting a provenance featured by juvenile arc-related igneous rocks with a duration of ca. 965-855 Ma. Their epsilon(Hf)(t) values intersect the depleted mantle curve at ca. 920-880 Ma and decrease steadily with ages, probably indicating a transition from oceanic arc to continental arc magmatism in their source. In contrast, recycling of old continental crusts is significant in the sources of the Baizhu and Xiuning Formations. Hf isotope results of detrital zircons from the Baizhu Formation suggest two major crust reworking periods: one at 1600-800 Ma by 1700-1600 Ma juvenile crusts, and the other at 2500-1700 Ma by 3300-2500 Ma juvenile crusts. The ca. 2000 Ma age peak of the Xiuning Formation is more significant than those of the underlying folded metasedimentary sequences in the eastern JO, suggesting that the Xiuning Formation received more detritus from the Yangtze Block and thus the back-arc basins or peripheral basins along the JO may have been closed at ca. 765 Ma. Based on comparisons of detrital zircon U-Pb age spectrums and Hf isotopic characters with worldwide continents, we propose that the Early Neoproterozoic sediments at the southeastern margin of the Yangtze Block have close affinities with those from the India and East Antarctica, which matches a northwestern margin position for the SCB in the configuration of supercontinent Rodinia. Our results suggest that conglomerates can provide important and unrevealed information for crust growth and evolution especially when their sources were eroded or poor in the field.

   abstract = {The Liaohe Group is an important Paleoproterozoic lithostratigraphic unit of the Jiao-Liao-Ji orogenic belt and traditionally subdivided into the North and South Liaohe Groups. However, their tectonic setting and evolution are still a matter of debate. The precise depositional and metamorphic data of the studied metasedimentary rocks from the South Liaohe Group provide important information on the controversial discussion of the tectonic setting and evolution. Based on cathodoluminescence (CL) imaging and connecting LA-ICP-MS U-Pb geochronology, zircon grains separated from metasedimentary rocks of different formations of the South Liaohe Group were subdivided into detrital and metamorphic zircons or zircon domains. Igneous zircon cores of detrital zircons of the Li'eryu, Gaojiayu, Dashiqiao and Gaixian Formations yield U-Pb age peaks at similar to 2130 Ma, similar to 2520 Ma, similar to 2160Ma/similar to 2500Ma, and similar to 2040Ma, indicating that their sediments were transported from the Liaoji Granitoids, the Archean basement rocks of the adjacent Complex. In addition, deposition age of the sedimentary precursors was investigated which must have taken place at some time after similar to 2.05 Ga, similar to 2.07 Ga, similar to 2.04 Ga and similar to 1.92 Ga, respectively. These new geochronological data can be well explained by (1) a continent-arc collision model which suggests that the South Liaohe Group formed an intervening island arc and foreland basin sandwiched between the Longgang and Nangrim Complexes, and (2) a northward subduction of the Nangrim Complex source rocks of the South Liaohe Group; these source rocks were successively deposited along the margin of the two Complexes.},

   abstract = {Comprehensive studies of depositional age and source material of the Liaohe Group are significant to the tectonic evolution of the Jiao-Liao-Ji Belt (JLJB). The Gaixian Formation is widely distributed and stratigraphically defined as the uppermost formation of the Liaohe Group. However, our new work reveals that not all meta-sedimentary rocks of the Liaohe Group deposited before the late Paleoproterozoic orogeny. Based on the geochronological results, these meta-sedimentary rocks can be subdivided into two categories. Detrital zircon from the category A meta-sedimentary rocks yield U-Pb age peaks at ca. 2.50 Ga, 2.18 Ga and 2.06 Ga. The youngest age peak of ca. 2.06 Ga, together with the metamorphic age of 1.95-1.84 Ga yielded by pervious studies, indicate their depositional ages of 2.06-1.95 Ga. Compared to the category A, detrital zircon from the category B yield similar Pb-207/Pb-206 age peaks at ca. 2.54 Ga, ca. 2.17 Ga and ca. 2.05 Ga, but importantly also at ca. 1.87 Ga which was never observed for the category A. The late Paleoproterozoic zircon (similar to 1.87 Ga) include magmatic cores and weakly oscillatory zoned or unzoned rims. These rims yield two age peaks of ca. 1.88 Ga and ca. 1.80 Ga, which are interpreted as inherited partial melting ages. Therefore, the category B meta-sedimentary rocks deposited at some time after ca. 1.80 Ga. These new geochronological data reveal that the category B meta-sedimentary rocks are significantly different with those from the traditional Gaixian Formation. In combination with regional stratigraphy data, it is recommended that the category B meta-sedimentary rocks should be ascribed to the Changhai Group rather than the Liaohe Group.},

The Liaohe Group is an important research subject for understanding the Paleoproterozoic tectonic setting and evolution of the JLJB. However, the relationship of depositional spatial and chronological distributions between the North and South Liaohe groups are still under debates. In this paper, we present geochronological and zircon Lu-Hf isotopic results of meta-sedimentary rocks from the Liaohe Group to decipher their provenance depositional ages and environment, as well as their tectonic significance on the JLJB. The detrital zircons from the corresponding formations, including the Li'eryu, Gaojiayu and Dashiqiao formations of the North and South Liaohe groups, show similarities in age patterns and Hf isotopic compositions. The detrital zircons from the Li'eryu Formation of the two groups display unimodal Pb-207/Pb-206 age peaks at ca. 2.2-2.1 Ga. On the other hand, detrital zircons from the Gaojiayu and Dashiqiao formations of the two groups, yield two dominating age peaks at ca. 2.2-2.1 and similar to 2.5 Ga. In summary, all detrital zircons with age peaks at ca. 2.2-2.1 Ga, have epsilon(Hf)(t) value of -6.99 to +9.41 and two-stage Hf depleted mantle ages (T-DM2 model ages) of 3143 to 2137 Ma. The similar to 2.5 Ga detrital zircons however, have epsilon(Hf)(t) value and T-DM2 model ages which widely range from -9.37 to +10.13 and from 349 to 2367 Ma, respectively. Geochronological results indicate that ca. 2.2-2.1 Ga zircons were derived from the Liaoji granitoids. The adjacent basement rocks of the Longgang and Liaonan-Nangrim blocks provide the major sources to detrital zircons that yield an age peak at similar to 2.5 Ga. Combined with previous studies, the new geochronological data suggest that the protoliths of the corresponding formations of the North and South Liaohe groups deposited their detritus progressively in a back-arc basin. The Liaoji granitoids are the main sources providing detritus for the Li'eryu Formation. Subsequently, elastic sediments transported from the Longgang and Liaonan blocks, as well as from the Liaoji granitoids, were successively deposited and provided sources to the Gaojiayu and Dashiqiao formations.},

   abstract = {The Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB) is a natural laboratory of the Phanerozoic accretionary orogen. The eastern section of the CAOB contains several microcontinental massifs, and it is unknown whether these massifs carry Precambrian basement. Here we present the results of U-Pb dating of detrital zircons from the Dongfengshan and Tadong groups in the eastern margin of the Songnen-Zhangguangcai Range Massif. The Dongfengshan and Tadong groups are subdivided, from bottom to top, into the Liangzihe, Huapigou, and Honglin formations, and the Lalagou and Zhudundian formations, respectively. Zircons from a two-mica quartz schist (sample HCM4-2) in the Liangzihe Formation yielded eight age populations, from 821 to 1802 Ma, whereas zircons from a two-mica quartz schist (sample 12HCM3-2) in the Huapigou Formation yielded four age populations (752, 803, 821, and 851 Ma). Zircons from a two-mica schist in the Lalagou Formation of the Tadong Group yielded two age populations (450 and 485 Ma), and zircons from a biotite-bearing plagioclase gneiss in the lower part of the Zhudundian Formation yielded five main age populations, from 551 to 1815 Ma. Samples 11NNA5-1 and 11HNA10-1 from the upper layer of the Zhudundian Formation yielded six main age groups, from 749 to 948 Ma. These data, together with the ages of zircons within a tonalite that intrudes the Tadong Group and the overlying Chenming Formation, indicate the presence of a Precambrian terrane associated with sedimentation at various times during the Neoproterozoic, including at similar to 821-752, similar to 752-560, and similar to 750-516 Ma, on the eastern margin of the Songnen-Zhangguangcai Range Massif. The Dongfengshan and Tadong groups were previously thought to be Proterozoic, but our study reveals that they constitute a Neoproterozoic-Late Paleozoic tectonic melange. In addition, the widespread occurrence of detrital zircons with ages of 0.75-0.95, 1.5-1.6, 1.8, and 2.4-2.5 Ga provides evidence of a Neoproterozoic magmatic event and the presence of remnant ancient basement material within the Songnen-Zhangguangcai Range Massif.

Geochronological analysis revealed a different tectonic setting between the Ondor Sum complex (Tulinkai area) and the Erdaojing accretion complex, as detrital zircon U-Pb analysis identified different major age provenances: (1) the Precambrian basement of the North China Craton and Paleozoic Bainaimiao Arc along the northern margin of North China to the south are the provenance rocks of the schists in the Tulinkai area, and (2) the Precambrian basement of the Xilinhot complex and Paleozoic Baolidao arc to the north are the provenance rocks of the schists in the Erdaojing area. We infer that the existence of the ocean between the above two regions in the late of Early Paleozoic in accordance with the result of this study. Furthermore, a comparison of the youngest age population in the intruded-diorite rock and metasedimentary rocks with U-Pb ages implies that the final closure of the Paleo- Asian Ocean along the Solonker Suture Zone most likely occurred in the period between 239 and 222 Ma (Late Paleozoic-Triassic).},

   abstract = {Subduction erosion along active convergent plate margins involves arc subduction, tectonic erosion and sediment subduction. Here we investigate the metasedimentary rocks enclosing blueschists and edogites in the Changning-Menglian orogenic belt (CMOB) of the southeastern Tibetan Plateau which marks the main suture associated with the closure of the Paleo-Tethyan Ocean between the Baoshan-Tengchong and Lanping-Simao blocks. We present an integrated study of petrology, mineral chemistry, whole-rock geochemistry, zircon U-Pb geochronology, and phengite Ar-40/Ar-39 isotopes. These rocks consist mainly of Ph-Qz schist, Ab-Qz-Ph schist, Grt-Ph schist, St-Ky-bearing Grt-Ms schist, and Cld-Pg-Ph schist. They display compositions similar to arkose and subarkose with trace element patterns overlapping those of the upper continental crust, and suggest immature and weak to moderate chemical weathering. The detrital zircon age spectra are dominated by two major age groups of 600-450 Ma with a peak at 550 Ma, and 1150-850 Ma with a peak at 950 Ma, suggesting that the metasedimentary rocks were sourced from a mixture of Precambrian sediments in the Lanping-Simao Block and Pan-African Orogeny-related magmatic rocks with minor Early Paleozoic Proto-Tethyan subduction- and volcanic rocks related to the onset of oceanic spreading of Paleo-Tethys. Combined with the maximum depositional age of similar to 428 Ma based on the youngest detrital age peaks, we infer that the Lancang Group could be the Early Paleozoic sedimentary sequence of the Lanping-Simao Block and was deposited in a foreland setting. The metasedimentary rocks display high-pressure (HP) mineral assemblages involving Ph + Ab + Qz, Grt + Ph + Qz, Grt + Ky + Ph, and Cld + Pg + Ph, and record blueschist fades to eclogite facies peak P-T conditions of 18.8-21.6 kbar at 392-553 *C (Grt-Ph schists) and 20-24.2 kbar at 592-654 *C (St-Ky-bearing Grt-Ms schists). Metamorphic zircon U-Pb and phengite Ar-40/Ar-39 isotopic analyses from these rocks yield consistent peak HP ages of 238-235 and 237-231 Ma, respectively, whereas Ar-40/Ar-39 dating for the Grt-Ph schist with low Si contents in phengite yields the post-peak age at 226.2 +/- 1.3 Ma. We propose that a significant volume of sediments in Lancang Group at the western margin of the Lanping-Simao Block were off scraped by the downgoing oceanic lithosphere associated with the Paleo Tethyan ocean closure, and subducted to depths of similar to 60-80 km during Middle Triassic. These were subsequently rapidly exhumated at a rate of similar to 5.7-6.5 km/myr in the Late Triassic. The subduction erosion model proposed in our study has important implications for reconstructing the evolutionary history of the Paleo-Tethys as well as the architecture variation of the paleosubduction zone.

   abstract = {The accretionary complex of the Yarlung Zangbo Suture Zone (YZSZ) in southern Tibet records the subduction-accretion process of Neo-Tethys oceanic lithosphere. We report field observations, petrographic analysis, detrital zircon U-Pb geochronology, and Hf isotope data of one sedimentary-matrix melange unit of YZSZ in Sangsang area, central southern Tibet. This melange unit is the northernmost, and presumably the oldest one within the YZSZ accretionary complex. The sandstone matrix and blocks are rich in volcanic detritus, linking the main provenance to a juvenile magmatic arc. U-Pb-Hf analysis of detrital zircons from the sandstones reveals a unimodal age population of similar to 186-121 Ma with high positive epsilon Hf(t) values of +6.67 to +14.58, consistent with derivation from Gangdese Arc on southern margin of Lhasa terrane. The maximum depositional age of the melange unit is limited to be 149-134 Ma by averaging the youngest detrital zircon ages. The sandstones of this melange unit probably deposited in the trench basin within a few million years of early accretion driven by the Neo-Tethys oceanic subduction. The development of arc-trench system verified the initiation of subduction of Neo-Tethys oceanic lithosphere in Early Jurassic. Our results and integration of previous studies on subduction-accretion process of Neo-Tethys subduction indicate that the accretionary complex in Sangsang area documented at least two stages of accretion processes, stage 1 in earliest Cretaceous and stage 2 in Late Cretaceous, separated by a period of forearc extension forming the Yarlung Zangbo Ophiolites. These two stages of accretion correspond to growth and erosion of Gangdese Arc and crustal shortening in southern Eurasian margin.},

   abstract = {The Late Mesozoic Jiaolai basin preserves sediment source information that can help elucidate the tectonic history of East Shandong, China. The terrestrial Wangshi and Laiyang Groups are major components of the basin succession, but are not well studied in terms of their provenance and role in basin evolution. The Early Cretaceous Laiyang Group consists primarily of fluvial and lacustrine facies siltstones and sandstones, whereas the Late Cretaceous Wangshi Group consists of reddish fluvial siltstones and sandstones with interbedded conglomerates. This study reports detrital zircon age distributions from eight sandstones collected from the two groups. Age distributions exhibited four major populations of Palaeoproterozoic (2.5-2.4Ga), Palaeoproterozoic (1.9-1.8Ga), Neoproterozoic (850-700Ma), and Jurassic to Early Cretaceous (171-107Ma) ages. We interpret a maximum depositional age of 107Ma for the Wangshi Group and a depositional age of 121-120Ma for the upper Laiyang Group. Age distributions indicate that the Sulu orogenic belt of the East Shandong complex served as the primary source area. Detrital zircon age data also indicate major changes in the types of source material contributed to the Laiyang and Wangshi groups. Based on these shifts, we propose a four-stage model for Early Cretaceous evolution of the Jiaolai basin. In this model, subduction of the Pacific plate and associated transform motion on the Tan-Lu fault influenced the transition from a transpressional to an extensional tectonic setting.},

   abstract = {The Sulu orogenic belt (SOB) separates the North and South China blocks in East Asia and formed during Triassic continent-continent collision. However, late Mesozoic post-collisional exhumation is poorly understood due to lack of surface evidence for Paleo-Pacific subduction and associated effects. This paper interprets the tectonic history of the SOB using detrital zircon age data from Early Cretaceous sedimentary units along with previously published geochronologic and geochemical data to reconstruct sedimentological and tectonic history. Detrital zircon age distributions obtained from sedimentary units include a 2.0 Ga subpopulation that appears only in turbidite units to the southeast. This sediment probably derived from the Yangtze Block. Terrestrial facies from the Jiao-Lai basin to the northwest appear to derive from the North China Block. Geochronologic and geochemical data indicate that Early Cretaceous, post-collisional volcanism was compositionally bimodal (mafic-felsic) with associated intrusive activity that peaked at 120 Ma. Seismic images of northerly regions of the study area indicate this occurred in an extensional setting. Sedimentary facies and field structural analyses revealed an unconformity interpreted to reflect rapid uplift with NW-SE compression to the south. Given observed sinistral movement along the Tan-Lu fault, we interpret northwest and southeast regions of the SOB as experiencing transtensional and transpressional tectonics, respectively, driven by continuous subduction of the Paleo-Pacific Plate. Intrusion of the Late Yanshannian granitoids marked the final formational stage of this unique tectonic setting. (C) 2019, China University of Geosciences (Beijing) and Peking University.

These units preserve essential information on the Late Mesozoic evolution of the Sulu orogenic belt Referred to as the Baxiandun Formation, the turbidites exhibit similar lithologic characteristics to nearby units such as the Lingshandao Formation that have been well studied even though precise geochronologic constraints are lacking for a more precise correlation.

Lateral correlation among the marine turbidites, the Lingshandao and Baxiandun Formations, combined with information established by previous studies indicates initiation of transpressional tectonics at 122-121 Ma.

U-Pb age distributions of detrital zircon populations from the newly named Lingshandao Formation resemble that of overlying fluvial sedimentary rocks. Age distributions exhibit four main populations of Paleoproterozoic (2.5-2.3 Ga), Mesoproterozoic (2.1-1.9 Ga), Neoproterozoic (850-700 Ma) and Early Cretaceous (138-121 Ma) age, accompanied by sporadic occurrences of Archean, Paleozoic and early Mesozoic aged grains. Data indicate a depositional age of similar to 121 Ma for the Lingshandao Formation, which constrains the maximum depositional age of overlying fluvial sedimentary rocks. The Lingshandao Formation thus more likely correlates to the uppermost Laiyang Group of the Jiaolai basin. Proterozoic age populations indicate a mixture of material derived from the North China (NCB) and Yangtze Block (YZB) basement along with protolith material from the HP-UHP metamorphic units of the Sulu orogenic belt. Proterozoic age populations differ from those of the roughly coeval Jiaolai basin, which represents a terrestrial depositional environment to the north of the Sulu terrane.

   abstract = {Recent field geological investigations and sedimentary fades analysis have disclosed that the "Macaoyuan conglomerates" should be assigned to the dolomitized intraclastic lime grainstones rather than the basal conglomerates as previously reported. The conglomerates display depositionally-erosional conformable contacts with their underlying stratigraphic succession. There is no so-called "angular unconformity" or associated "Shennong movement" between the Macaoyuan Group and Shennongjia Group. The Macaoyuan Group consists primarily of carbonate platform facies association and mixed clastic and carbonate shelf facies association, while the "Macaoyuan conglomerates" are mainly made up of carbonate platform slope-channel gravity flow deposits. The sedimentary structures such as basal scouring structures, slump-convolute structures, imbricate structures, inverse grading bedding and lenticular filling deposits are well developed in the slope-channel gravity flow sedimentary succession, whereas cross bedding, wavy bedding, parallel bedding, ripple bedding, and normal grading bedding are common in the mixed inner shelf and platform-margin shoal sedimentary succession. The SHRIMP and LA-ICP-MS zircon age dating techniques are employed for the synsedimentary tuff sample collected from the upper part and sedimentary detrital zircons from the topmost part of the Baliya Formation in the lower part of the Macaoyuan Group. The synsedimentary tuff sample gives a SHRIMP zircon U-Pb age of 1157 +/- 19 Ma, which agrees well with the maximum depositional age of 1180 Ma for the sedimentary detrital zircons. It follows that the age of deposition of the Macaoyuan Group should be traced back to the Mesoproterozoic rather than the Neoproterozoic. The ages of the detrital zircons are mainly concentrated in two time intervals: 1.16-1.26 Ga and 2.60-2.95 Ga. The ca. 2.60 Ga as a marked peak age may represent an important period for the crustal accretion and evolution of the Yangtze block. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {The Neoproterozoic sedimentary strata in the central Jiangnan Orogen of South China are separated into the Lengjiaxi and Banxi groups by a mid-Neoproterozoic angular unconformity. This unconformity, previously interpreted as the evidence of continental collision between the Yangtze and Cathaysia blocks, is crucial for understanding the Neoproterozoic tectonic regime in the South China Craton. Here we report U-Pb ages and in situ Lu-Hf isotopes of detrital zircon grains from the sedimentary rocks near this unconformity. Zircon grains in meta-sandstone samples collected from the top part of Lengjiaxi Group yield maximum depositional ages of similar to 827 Ma, similar to 828 Ma and 836 Ma, and combined with other available age data, we suggest that the upper limit of the sedimentation for Lengjiaxi Group is at ca. 825 Ma. Zircon U-Pb analysis for two sandstone samples collected from the bottom of Banxi Group and Nanhuan strata yields two youngest ages of 797 Ma and 719 Ma, marking the initial depositional ages for these strata. All the samples contain abundant Neoproterozoic euhedral zircon grains, suggesting their near-source provenance. The Hf isotopic model ages of detrital zircons with positive epsilon(Hf)(t) values reveal two periods of juvenile crustal growth at 1.5-0.9 Ga and 2.8-1.6 Ga in the Yangtze Block. Several grains display core-rim structure with ages of rim part ranging from 864 to 851 Ma. We correlate these metamorphic ages with the amalgamation of Yangtze and Cathaysia blocks in the central segments. Our data in combination with those from other studies suggest that a back-arc basin existed in the central Jiangnan belt during ca. 860 Ma to ca. 825 Ma.

Variations in sandstone composition suggest that the Upper Carboniferous - Lower Triassic sediments displayed less sedimentary recycling than the Middle-Upper Triassic sediments. U-Pb isotopic dating using the LA-ICP-MS method on zircons from 12 sandstones exhibited similar zircon U-Pb age distribution patterns with major age groups at 360-320 Ma and 320-300 Ma, and with some grains giving ages of > 541 Ma, 541-360 Ma, 300-250 Ma and 250-200 Ma. Coupled with the compiled palaeocurrent data, the predominant sources were the Late Carboniferous volcanic rocks of the North Tianshan and Palaeozoic magmatic rocks of the Yili-Central Tianshan. There was also input from the Bogda Mountains in Middle-Late Triassic time. The comprehensive geological evidence indicates that the Upper Carboniferous - Lower Permian strata were probably deposited in an extensional context which was related to a rift or post-collision rather than arc-related setting. Conspicuously, the large range of U-Pb ages of the detrital zircons, increased sedimentary lithic fragments, fluvial deposits and contemporaneous Triassic zircon ages argue for a Middle-Late Triassic orogenic movement, which was considered to be the initial uplift of the Bogda Mountains.},

   abstract = {Recent studies have indicated that an Andean-type orogen (Lhasaplano) developed on the Lhasa block in the Cretaceous during northward subduction of Neo-Tethyan oceanic lithosphere. When and how uplift of the Lhasaplano began, however, has remained controversial. This article integrates stratigraphic, sedimentological, tectonic, and provenance data from the latest marine to nonmarine strata in the Linzhou Basin to pinpoint the early topographic growth in southern Tibet. The Takena Formation mainly consists of lagoonal carbonates and mudstones yielding foraminiferal assemblages of Early Aptian age (ca. 123-119.5 Ma). The conformably overlying lower member of the Shexing Formation, mainly deposited in fluvial environments, was fed by volcanic and sedimentary rock fragments from the north Lhasa terrane. Clasts of the Gangdese arc to the south firstly appeared in the middle member and became dominant in the upper member of the Shexing Formation. By contrast, coarse grained, braided river facies occur in the uppermost part of the Shexing Formation, where detritus was mostly recycled from Paleozoic strata of north Lhasa, with minor volcaniclastic contribution from the Gangdese arc. Basin analysis indicates accelerating subsidence and sedimentation rates during deposition of Takena to middle Shexing strata (ca. 125-108 Ma), followed by steady subsidence during deposition of upper Shexing strata (ca. 108-96 Ma). Given this regional tectonic and sedimentary evidence, such an evolution is interpreted to reflect tectonic extension followed by thermal subsidence. Basin inversion and regional compression initiated during deposition of the uppermost Shexing strata (ca. 96 Ma), as indicated by active thrust faults and widespread accumulation of syntectonic conglomerates in the western part of the Lhasa block. This event marked the beginning of the Andean-type orogeny in southern Tibet. Such a paleotectonic evolution, from extension to tectonic inversion, is also documented in the Andes mountain range. It may be typical of the early stage growth of Andean-type active continental margins.},

   abstract = {Constraining the timing of early topographic growth on the Tibetan plateau is critical for any models of India-Asia collision, Himalayan orogeny and subsequent plateau development in the Cenozoic. Stratigraphic, sedimentological and provenance analysis of the Lower Cretaceous red-beds of the Damxung Conglomerate provide new key information to reconstruct the paleogeography and the tectonic evolution of the Lhasa terrane at the time. The over 700-m-thick Damxung Conglomerate documents distal alluvial fan to braidplain sedimentation passing upward to proximal alluvial fan sedimentation. Deposition began near sea level, as documented by limestone beds occurring at the base of the unit. Zircon U-Pb dating of interbedded tuff layers constrain deposition age at ca. 111 Ma. Abundance of volcanic clasts, Cretaceous U-Pb ages and Hf isotopes of detrital zircons yielding mainly negative eHf(t) values together with paleocurrent data indicate an active volcanic source located in the North Lhasa subterrane. Pre-Mesozoic-aged zircon, recycled quartz and (meta) sedimentary rock fragments increase up-section, indicating progressive erosional exhumation of the Paleozoic sedimentary/ metasedimentary basement. The Damxung Conglomerate thus records a significant uplift and unroofing stage in the source region, implying initial topographic growth on the Lhasa terrane at early Albian time. Early Cretaceous topographic growth on the Lhasa terrane is supported by the stratigraphic record in the Linzhou basin, the Xigaze forearc basin and the southern Nima basin. In contrast, marine strata in the central-western Lhasa terrane lasted until the early Cenomanian (ca. 96 Ma), indicating diachronous marine regression on the Lhasa terrane from east to west.},

   abstract = {The Upper Triassic Langjiexue Group, exposed south of the Yarlung-Zangbo suture zone in south Tibet, shows sedimentary features different from typical Tethyan Himalayan successions, and its origin is controversial. In this article we combine field observations with paleocurrent, petrologic, geochronological and isotopic data to determine the provenance of Langjiexue sandstones. These middle to distal deep-sea-fan turbidites are crosscut by Lower Cretaceous diabase sills and dikes generated during rifting of India from Gondwana, indicating that the Langjiexue Group was originally deposited along or adjacent to the northern passive continental margin of India. Flute casts at the base of turbidite beds indicate mostly WNW-ward paleocurrents, pointing to provenance from a source located east of the depositional area. Common volcanic fragments and plagioclase grains together with a cluster of 400-200-Ma-aged magmatic zircons with uniform epsilon(Hf)(t) values from -5 to +10 are incompatible with any nearby sources, including the Qiantang Block, the Lhasa Block or the India subcontinent, and indicate instead supply from a long-lived magmatic-arc terrane. Considering what is known about Late Triassic paleogeography, a plausible source for Langjiexue sediments is represented by the Gondwanide Orogen, generated during subduction of the pan-Pacific oceanic lithosphere beneath southeastern Gondwana. This scenario is supported by the age range and Hf isotopic signatures of Late Paleozoic-Early Mesozoic zircons contained in Langjiexue turbidites as in coeval turbidites exposed in western Myanmar. New data are needed to confirm/falsify the existence of a thousand-km-long sediment-routing system similar to the modern Amazon, which sourced in a cordillera-type orogen rising along the southeastern margin of Gondwana - crossed an entire continent to feed turbiditic fans now exposed from western Myanmar to the northern Tethys Himalaya.

   abstract = {The multiphase emplacements of granitoids and well-developed depositional sequences from Neoproterozoic to Mesozoic are exposed widely in the Wugongshan domain of South China provide important keys for the reconstruction of the pre-Mesozoic tectonic evolution of the Cathaysia Block. Here we present the results from geological investigations, detrital zircon U-Pb geochronology, in situ Hf-isotope and REE composition of the Ordovician meta-sandstones, together with the U-Pb age data on a Mesozoic pluton with an attempt to evaluate the petrogenesis and crustal evolution history. A group of 276 detrital zircon U-Pb ages are reported from four meta-sandstones which show five major age populations: 2630-2350 Ma with a peak of 2440 Ma, 1890-1540 Ma (peak of 1680 Ma), 1120-870 Ma (peak of 980 Ma), 810-700 Ma (peak of 760 Ma) and 660-510 Ma (peak of 550 Ma). Among these, the most prominent age at 980 Ma fits well with the collisional event of Yangtze and Cathaysia Blocks. The second prominent age at 760 Ma correlates with a breakup of Rodinia, and the third one at 1680 Ma corresponds to the initial breakup of Columbia. For the fourth (peak of 2440 Ma) and fifth (peak of 550 Ma) ages, no corresponding magmatic rocks are exposed in the study area or in the adjacent regions, although the age populations broadly correspond to the global continental growth in the early Paleoproterozoic and the latest Neoproterozoic 'Pan-African' orogeny. We obtained 132 in situ Hf isotope compositions, among which 98 show negative epsilon Hf(t) values (-36.88 to -0.3) with two-stage model ages (T-DM2) of 3.5-1.7 Ga (peak of 2.2 Ga), and 34 display positive epsilon Hf(t) values (+0.3 to +9.89) with crystallization ages of 1.5-1.1 Ga (peak of 1.4 Ga). Zircons from two Mesozoic granitic samples yield rather similar late Jurassic ages of 158.1 +/- 2.1 Ma and 154.0 +/- 3.9 Ma. All the corresponding epsilon Hf(t) values of zircons are negative (-242 to -42) and the Hf two-stage model ages range from 1.5 to 3.0 Ga with a peak of 1.68 Ga. Combined with previous age data on 120 Ma massive granitoids and 230 Ma on ductile sheared plutons, we consider that the magmatism in the Wugong complex started from the late Triassic, and reached a peak in the late Jurassic, but was gradually weakened since the early Cretaceous (130 Ma) and culminated at 120 Ma. Almost all the Wugongshan granitic plutons were derived from the partial melting of Mesoproterozoic crustal material, with little mantle components. We also discuss the provenance of the metasedimentaty rocks and pre-Mesozoic crustal evolution of Cathaysia. (C) 2014 International Association for Gondwana Research. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Detrital zircons collected from Zhoulao () core provide an ideal sample for the provenance studies.

   abstract = {Chemical composition of sedimentary rocks bears important clues on source rock characteristics and sedimentary processes, providing a critical record of the evolving continental crust Whole-rock major and trace elements, and detrital zircon U-Pb-Hf isotopic data for metapelites of the Archean Yangpo "Group" in the newly discovered Zhongxiang Complex, South China, are employed to investigate the age, provenance, and sedimentary processes of the protoliths, so as to further characterize the early crustal evolution of the Yangtze Craton. Detrital zircon cores from the metapelites yielded a youngest age of around 2.70 Ga with metamorphic rims dated at 1.95 Ga, which in combination with previous geochronological studies on granitic bodies intruding the Yangpo "Group" constrain the depositional age between 2.70 and 2.67 Ga. This makes the protolith of the Yangpo "Group" the oldest sedimentary unit in the Yangtze Craton. Geochemical signatures of the metapelites indicate relatively weak chemical weathering of the source area and weak to moderate post-depositional silicification and K-metasomatism. Diagnostic trace element ratios and REE patterns suggest that the protoliths of the Yangpo metapelites are compositionally immature with a mixed source of (ultra)-mafic (>60%) and felsic rocks, which possibly accumulated in a basin near an active continental margin. Detrital zircons in the Yangpo metapelites are dominated by 2.92-2.85 Ga and 2.80-2.73 Ga age populations with two prominent peaks at 2.87 Ga and 2.78 Ga, which are in agreement with the zircon ages and Hf isotopic compositions of the known older magmatic rocks in the Zhongxiang Complex, indicating that the proximal basement rocks were the principal detrital source. Integrated zircon age and Hf-isotope data suggest that the Archean continental crust of the Zhongxiang Complex was built through three major episodes of crustal growth at 3.55-3.45 Ga, 3.40-3.0 Ga, and 2.92-2.85 Ga, followed by two major episodes of crustal reworking at 2.80-2.70 Ga and 2.67-2.62 Ga. Such a crustal history distinguishes the Zhongxiang Complex from other Archean crustal provinces of the Yangtze Craton, pointing to a complex Archean evolutionary history for the Yangtze Craton.

The age spectra and whole-rock geochemistry show that the detrital materials of the Shenshan Formation originated from the Yangtze Block and that the detritus of the Kuli and Shangshi formations came mainly from the Yangtze Block and partly from the Cathaysia Block. The source for the Neoproterozoic sedimentary rocks in the Xiangshan area may been intermediate rocks, mainly from a mixture of felsic and mafic rocks in the Yangtze Block.

Detrital zircon geochronology defines at least five populations: 2658-2370 Ma, 1866-1500 Ma, 1390-1268 Ma, 1250-858 Ma, and 830-700 Ma. The 2648-2370 Ma population may correspond to the Neoarchean global continental growth. The 1816-1510 Ma population may represent a subduction event caused by the assembly of the Columbia supercontinent. The 1390-1268 Ma and 1250-858 Ma population reflect the tectono-thermal events associated with the assembly of the Rodinia supercontinent, while the 830-700 Ma population may be associated with the breakup of the Rodinia supercontinent. Detrital zircon Hf isotopic compositions indicate that the mechanism involves multiple juvenile inputs and the reworking of older crustal materials. The sandstones and mudstones display K2O enrichment, but they are moderately to extremely depleted in Na2O, CaO and Sr. The major and trace elements reveal that the sandstones and mudstones were derived from recycled felsic rocks and deposited in the passive continental margin. The compositions of the protoliths are inferred equivalent to andesite to granodiorite. The petrographic and geochemical features indicate that the sandstones and mudstones have undergone medium to intensive chemical weathering. Conversion of aluminous clay minerals to illite is inferred to be the predominant post-depositional potash metasomatism.},

   abstract = {The Qilian block, one of the Precambrian terranes in the Qinling-Qilian-Kunlun orogenic system, is a critical region for reconstruction of the overall architecture and tectonic evolution of NW China. This investigation of zircon U-Pb and Lu-Hf isotopes and whole-rock geochemistry of a metasupracrustal sequence in the North Wulan terrane provides new insights into the Qilian block. A Statherian-Calymmian unit (ca. 1.67-1.5 Ga), dominated by Al- and Si-rich gneisses, arkosites, quartzites, and amphibolites with minor calc-silicate rocks and marbles, is interpreted to have been deposited during continental rifting. Detrital zircons show two main age populations of 2685-2276 and 2098-1761 Ma with mostly negative epsilon(Hf)(t) values (-14.0 to +3.6). The sources are characterized by mixed felsic to intermediate igneous rocks as well as recycled components and are interpreted as being derived from the Tarim craton because of the age distribution of their detrital zircons. A Stenian-Tonian unit (ca. 1.1-0.9 Ga) consists mainly of felsic gneisses, quartzites, calc-silicate rocks, marbles, metavolcanic rocks, and amphibolites. The metasedimentary rocks yielded detrital zircon ages clustering at ca. 1.64, 1.43, 1.3-1.2, 1.1, and 0.94 Ga with predominantly positive epsilon(Hf)(t) values (-7.1 to +9.7). One metavolcanic rock has an age of ca. 1110 Ma and epsilon(Hf)(t) values of +6.5 to +9.1. The provenance is dominated by local syndepositional arc-related igneous rocks with older detritus possibly from Laurentia, again based on the age distribution of the detrital zircons. The Central Qilian and Hualong terranes show strong affinities with the North Wulan terrane and together constituted a single coherent Qilian block prior to their involvement in the Qilian-North Qaidam orogen. The Qilian block was probably once part of the Tarim craton and had a strong linkage to South Tarim, which drifted from North Tarim during the breakup of Columbia in the early Mesoproterozoic. We suggest that, from the late Mesoproterozoic to early Neoproterozoic, the South Tarim-Qilian formed an active continental margin located close to Laurentia during the assembly of Rodinia. The final collision occurred in the early Neoproterozoic with the formation of a significant continent that included the reunified Tarim-Qilian as well as Qaidam-Kunlun and Qinling terranes, Alxa block, Kyrgyz-Chinese Tianshan, and Yili block.},

   abstract = {The surface uplift of the Tibetan Plateau (TP) and its geomorphology evolution has triggered aridification of Asia's interior and drainage development at the eastern margin of the plateau. However, how the pre-Cenozoic early growth histories of the TP impact the drainage system and climate is poorly constrained. The Late Mesozoic Lacustrine evaporite-bearing basins on the eastern margin of the TP record significant information on the uplift of the source terranes, source-to-sink system development and climate change. In this study, we presented detrital zircon U-Pb ages from the Upper Cretaceous Yunlong Formation in the Lanping Basin, as well as Hf isotopic, petrographic, direct statistical, and multidimensional scaling analyses, and use them to characterize the provenance and reconstruct the drainage system. All of the samples have five major age peaks at 200-290 Ma, 400-490 Ma, 750-1000 Ma, 1750-1950 Ma, and 2400-2600 Ma with mostly negative epsilon(Hf)(t) values (81%). We infer the sediments are primarily derived from recycled sediments of the Songpan-Garze terrane, and partly from the Sichuan Basin and the Southern Qiangtang terrane, aswell as the exposed magmatic rocks of the Yidun Arc and Songpan-Garze terrane. The provenance features of the contemporaneous sediments from the Sichuan, Xichang, Chuxiong, and Simao basins indicate a complex hierarchical drainage pattern on the eastern margin of the TP during the Late Cretaceous. The hierarchical drainage system exhibits a complete gradational cycle of lake-basin types from overfilled freshwater Sichuan Basin through balanced fill saline Xichang Basin and underfilled hypersaline Chuxiong, Lanping, Simao, and Khorat Plateau basins from proximal to distal. The early growth of the TP primarily controlled the drainage and lake-basin evolution by not only causing the uplift and exhumation of the source areas and providing large amounts of clastic material to the proximal sub-drainage areas but also intensifying the aridity and deposition of evaporites.

   abstract = {Metamorphic basement rocks in the Cathaysia Block are composed mainly of meta-sediments with different ages. New zircon U-Pb geochronological results from the meta-sedimentary rocks exposed in the Zengcheng and Hezi areas, southern Cathaysia Block, show that they consist dominantly of early Neoproterozoic (1.0-0.9 Ga) materials with minor Paleo-to Mesoproterozoic and late Neoproterozoic (0.8-0.6 Ga) components, suggesting that the detritus mostly come from a Grenvillian orogen. The youngest detrital zircon ages place a constraint on the deposition time of these sediments in Late Neoproterozoic. Zircon Hf isotopic compositions indicate that the Grenvillian zircons were derived from the reworking of Mesoproterozoic arc magmatic rocks and Paleoproterozoic continental crust, implying an arc-continent collisional setting. Single-peak age spectra and the presence of abundant euhedral Grenvillian zircons suggest that the sedimentary provenance is not far away from the sample location. Thus, the Grenvillian orogen probably preexisted along the southern margin of the Cathaysia Block, or very close to the south. Similarity in the ages of Grenvillian orogeny and the influence of the assembly of Gondwana in South China with India and East Antarctic are discussed, with suggestion that South China was more likely linked with the India-East Antarctica continents in Early Neoproterozoic rather than between western Laurentia and eastern Australia.},

   abstract = {South China is the largest block of Rodinia in southeastern Asia. It consists of the Yangtze and Cathaysia blocks, separated by the Jiangshan-Shaoxing-Pingxiang Fault. Most studies suggest that the two blocks were amalgamated in the early Neoproterozoic, and the middle Neoproterozoic vocano-sedimentary sequences on both blocks were deposited in a post-collisional rift basin (the Nanhua rift basin). Here, we conducted a geochemical and geochronological study of a turbidite sequence at the western margin of the Cathaysia Block that was previously considered to have been deposited in the Nanhua rift basin. The sedimentary rocks are characterized by bathypelagic to bathyal facies. They are composed of siliciclastic sedimentary rocks interlayered with tuffaceous materials and have geochemical compositions between felsic to intermediate arc igneous rocks. Abundant euhedral detrital zircons define a major age peak at ca. 790-770 Ma, indicating that the detrital grains were derived mostly from locally distributed syn-sedimentary middle Neoproterozoic arc igneous rocks. Predominance of zircons with ages close to the time of deposition and the whole-rock trace element compositions of the turbidite sequence also imply a convergent plate margin setting for the turbidite. The Hf isotopic compositions of the Neoproterozoic detrital zircons suggest that their provenance consisted of largely reworked crustal materials, inconsistent with a potential interpretation that similarly aged igneous rocks in the Jiangnan Orogen were the provenance. These lines of evidence, combined with other available data, suggest that the western margin of the Cathaysia Block (the West Cathaysia terrane) bears more similarities to the western and northern margins of the Yangtze Block and northern India and formed part of a Neoproterozoic subduction-accretion system located along the margin of Rodinia. We suggest that early Paleozoic strike-slip movement along the Jiangshan-Shaoxing-Pingxiang Fault played a significant role in shaping the current tectonic framework of South China by bringing the West Cathaysia terrane to its present position with respect to the Yangtze Block.},

The zircon dating indicates that the Fanjingshan Group, which previously was regarded as 870 Ma old, actually was deposited in a similar to 800 Ma rift basin similar to other contemporaneous basins in the Yangtze Block; the regional unconformity separating the Fanjingshan Group from the overlying Xiajing Group is dated to 800-740 Ma. Differences in clast compositions and the trace-element and Hf-isotope signatures of zircons between the Fanjingshan Group and the Xiajiang Group suggest changes in the source areas within the Yangtze Block. The combined ages and Hf-isotope data for each group show different histories of crustal evolution in their source areas. In the Yangtze Block, a previously unrecognized source (similar to 4.3 Ga) is suggested by the Hf model ages of the oldest zircons. Both recycling of ancient crustal materials and minor addition of juvenile material took place in the time intervals 2.5-2.4 Ga. 2.0-1.7 Ga and 0.85-0.8 Ga. The most important generation of juvenile crust appears to have occurred at 1.6-1.4 Ga in the source area of the Fanjingshan Group, and at 0.95-0.85 Ga and 0.78-0.74 Ga in the source area of the Xiajiang Group.

   abstract = {A combined study of Lu-Hf isotopes and U-Pb ages for detrital zircons from sedimentary rocks can provide information on the crustal evolution of sedimentary provenances, and comparisons with potential source regions can constrain interpretations of paleogeographic settings. Detailed isotopic data on detrital zircons from Neoproterozoic sedimentary rocks in the northern part of the Yangtze Block suggest that these rocks have the maximum depositional ages of similar to 750 Ma, and share a similar provenance. In their source area, units of late Archean (2.45 to 2.55 Ga) to Paleoproterozoic (1.9 to 2.0 Ga) U-Pb ages made up the basement, and were overlain or intruded by magmatic rocks of Neoproterozoic U-Pb ages (740 to 900 Ma). Hf isotopic signatures of the detrital zircons indicate that a little juvenile crust formed in the Neoarchean; reworking of old crust dominates the magmatic activity during the Archean to Paleoproterozoic, while the most significant juvenile addition to the crust occurred in the Neoproterozoic. Only the Neoproterozoic zircon U-Pb ages can be matched with known magmatism in the northern Yangtze Block, while other age peaks cannot be correlated with known provenance areas. Similar zircon U-Pb ages have been obtained previously from sediments along the southeastern and western margins of the Yangtze Block. Thus, it is suggested that an unexposed old basement is widespread beneath the Yangtze Block and was the major contributor to the Neoproterozoic sediments. This basement had a magmatic activity at similar to 2.5 Ga, similar to that in North China; but zircon Hf isotopes suggest significant differences in the overall evolutionary histories between the Yangtze and North China.

   abstract = {In situ U-Pb and Lu-Hf data on detrital zircons from Paleo- to Neoproterozoic sediments have been used to gain a clearer picture of the regional tectonic background and crustal evolution in the western part of the Yangtze Block. The youngest concordant zircon ages for sedimentary units suggest maximum depositional ages of 1014 Ma for the Kunyang Group, 750-649 Ma for the Sinian sequences, and 525 Ma for the Cambrian sediments. The Yinmin Formation, previously assigned to the middle part of the Kunyang Group, was actually deposited after 1667 Ma and contains zircons whose ages are dominantly from late Archean to Paleoproterozoic (2.8-2.7 Ga, 2.5-2.3 Ga and similar to 1.85 Ga). The Heishantou Formation in the lower part of the Kunyang Group has two major age populations of similar to 1.0 Ga and 1.8-1.6 Ga. The Sinian and Cambrian sedimentary rocks are dominated by Neoproterozoic zircons with age peaks at similar to 760 Ma and similar to 825 Ma, consistent with the ages of widespread igneous rocks around the Yangtze Block. The Lu-Hf isotope data suggest that a significant juvenile input took place during Archean and Neoproterozoic times, respectively, while crustal reworking was dominant during the Paleoproterozoic time. The Archean-Paleoproterozoic detritus is isotopically distinct from the Archean-Paleoproterozoic basement exposed in the northern part of the Yangtze Block, suggesting that a subarea of old crust lies beneath the young sediments covering the craton. The presence of abundant similar to 1.85 Ga zircons suggests that the Yangtze Block was probably part of the Columbia supercontinent during Paleoproterozoic time. Comparisons to the other parts of Columbia suggest that the Yangtze Block could have been adjacent to the North China Craton and/or Australia. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Our results indicate that the Lagar Formation was deposited during the Late Carboniferous to Early Permian in a shallow-marine environment on the northern margin of Gondwana. Glacial marine diamictites are common within the Lagar Formation and record glaciation of Gondwana during the Late Palaeozoic. Moreover, the detrital materials of the Lagar formation originated mostly from the collision orogenic belt. The ages of detrital zircon grains from the Lagar Formation make up five main groups with ages of 410-540 Ma, 550-650 Ma, 800-1100 Ma, 1600-1800 Ma, and 2300-2500 Ma, which display three characteristic age peaks at similar to 1150, 2390 and 2648 Ma.

   abstract = {The Mesozoic tectonic framework of the Chinese Tianshan orogen is ambiguous. However, thick Mesozoic sediments both inside and in front of the orogen can provide clues to solve this problem. LA-ICPMS U-Pb dating on detrital zircons and electron microprobe analysis on detrital heavy minerals are carried out on the Triassic to Middle Jurassic sediments along the Kuqa River section in the northern Tarim basin and in two intermountain basins (Bayanbulak basin and Gongnaisi valley), to reveal the change in provenance through time and space. Zircons from the Kuqa River section are mainly of magmatic origin and their ages have a wide range from 2800 to 234 Ma, 70.5% of which are Palaeozoic. This age signature indicates a main provenance from the Tianshan orogen. Detrital heavy minerals (garnet and tourmaline) from the Kuqa River section suggest a complex provenance from granitic and metamorphic rocks of the South Tianshan belt, the South Tianshan suture and the Yili-Central Tianshan block. Detrital zircon U-Pb ages of the Early-Middle Jurassic sandstones from the Gongnaisi valley and Bayanbulak basin are predominantly Palaeozoic, without Precambrian, indicating a simple source from the Yili-Central Tianshan block. The different features of detrital zircon ages and heavy mineral chemical compositions in individual sample reflect provenance changes due to continuous denudation and pediplanation of the Chinese West Tianshan orogen in an extensional setting during Triassic to Middle Jurassic: (1) during Early to Middle Triassic, the South Tianshan belt towered to the north of Tarim basin, acting as a watershed and being the main source area for northern Tarim basin; (2) since Late Triassic to Early Jurassic, material from southern Yili-Central Tianshan block was largely transported to Tarim basin because of the continuous denudation of the South Tianshan belt; (3) in Middle Jurassic, the Chinese Western Tianshan orogen reached a peneplain state, resulting in the direct deposition in intermountain basins and the decrease of sediment supplying from Yili-Central Tianshan block to Tarim.

   abstract = {We conducted an integrated study including U-Pb dating and Lu-Hf isotope analysis for detrital zircons from the turbidites of the North Tianshan Accretionary Complex, northern Chinese West Tianshan, to constrain their depositional age, source characteristics and tectonic setting. Almost all the detrital zircons display well developed oscillatory zoning textures and have high Th/U ratios, reflecting an igneous origin. Based on the analytical results, the depositional ages of the four samples were 303 Ma-312 Ma, 310 Ma and 321 Ma. The studied samples all display unimodal detrital zircon spectra, with few Precambrian zircons, coinciding with the age spectra of sediments deposited in convergent basins, most likely a forearc basin. Most of the zircons and other mineral grains have euhedral to subhedral shapes, reflecting a relatively short transportation distance. Considering the occurrence of volcanic lithic fragments in thin-sections of the sandstones, we propose that the northern edge of Yili Block, which is widely accepted as a Paleozoic continental arc formed by subduction of the North Tianshan Ocean, was the most likely source area for the North Tianshan turbidites. There are 137 Lu-Hf isotope analyses on zircons with concordant U-Pb ages, all showing positive epsilon(Hf)(t) values (epsilon(Hf)(t) = + 2.9-+ 15.8), and young T-DM(C) ages (328-1152 Ma, peak at 400-800 Ma). The Hf isotope characteristics indicate important growth of juvenile crust and minor crustal contamination during the formation of the zircons' host rocks. When we examine the Hf isotope of reported magmatic rocks from the northern Yili Block, we found an increasing trend of eHf(t) values from the Early Paleozoic to Late Paleozoic. This indicates that there was a large amount of juvenile material extracted from the depleted mantle in the Carboniferous. Taking into account of previous research, we conclude that the northern West Tianshan was a subduction-arc system during the Carboniferous, and the studied turbidites from the North Tianshan Accretionary Complex were sourced from the magmatic arc of the northern Yili Block and most likely deposited in a fore-arc basin in the Late Carboniferous.},

We report detrital zircon U-Pb dating and Hf isotope results for a sandstone from the Lower Carboniferous Anjihai Formation in the northern margin of the Yili Block, to reveal the geochronological framework of the northern Yili Block, and discuss the subduction process of the North Tianshan Ocean (NTO). The detrital zircon ages were divided into 2 clusters, namely, the Precambrian and Palaeozoic ones. The Palaeozoic age group can be further divided into 3 subgroups, that is, 472-461Ma, 448-423Ma, and 406-335Ma, with peaks at 465, 436, and 346Ma, respectively. All the Palaeozoic zircons have oscillatory zoning textures and high Th/U ratios, showing an igneous provenance. The zircon Ti-temperatures are between 584 and 809 degrees C, suggesting that their source rocks were I- or S-type granitic rocks. In addition, most of the Palaeozoic zircons have positive epsilon(Hf)(t) values, indicating that the source rocks of the Palaeozoic zircons are derived from not only Mesoproterozoic continental crust but also involved depleted mantle components, which matched well with the Hf isotopic signatures of magmatic rocks from the northern Yili Block. Based on the regional geology, these zircons were thought to be sourced from magmatic rocks that were related to the subduction of the NTO. Taking into consideration the Middle-Late Ordovician arc-type granitoids in the Wenquan area, we conclude that the northern margin of the Yili Block was a unified active continental margin in the Palaeozoic, and the subduction of the NTO started at least from the Middle Ordovician.},

   abstract = {The Pamir Plateau region of the Northwestern Tibetan Plateau forms a prominent tectonic salient, separating the Tajik and Tarim basins. However, the topographic evolution of the Pamir Plateau remains elusive, despite the key role of this region played in the retreat of the Paratethys Ocean and in aridification across Central Asia. Therefore, the SW Tarim and Tajik basins are prime locations to decipher the geological history of the Pamir Plateau. Here, we present detrital zircon U/Pb and apatite fission-track (DAFT) ages from the Keliyang section of the SW Tarim Basin. DAFT ages show that sediments had three components during the Late Cretaceous and two components since the Oligocene. Detrital zircon U/Pb ages mainly cluster between 400 and 500 Ma during the Late Cretaceous, and coincide with ages of the Songpan-Ganzi and the West Kunlun Mountains. In contrast, detrital zircon U/Pb ages in the Eocene sediments are centered at around 200-300 Ma and 40-70 Ma, with a peak at similar to 45 Ma, consistent with data from the Central Pamir and the West Kunlun Mountains. The similar to 45 Ma peak in detrital zircon U/Pb ages since the Eocene indicates a new sedimentary source from the Central Pamir. Non-metric multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) analyses also show that the sedimentary source was closer to the Central Pamir after the Eocene, when compared to the Late Cretaceous. The result shows a clear Eocene provenance change in the Keliyang area. Moreover, this Eocene provenance shift has been detected in previous studies, in both the Tajik and Tarim basins, suggesting that the entire Central Pamir region likely experienced quasi-simultaneous abrupt uplift and paleo-geomorphological changes during the Eocene.</p>},

Their epsilon(Hf(t)) values range from -20 to 10 (72% negative values) and 12 to 5 (75% negative values), respectively. In West Australia, two main peaks at 700-500 and 1200-1100 Ma characterize Neoproterozoic to early Paleozoic strata and the 950-750 Ma population featuring South Tarim is absent. In Arabia-Iran, zircons from Neoproterozoic-Ordovician strata are characterized by 1000-500 Ma ages with a main peak at ca. 660 Ma and predominantly positive epsilon(Hf(t)) values (65%). Instead, zircons from Neoproterozoic-Ordovician strata in North India are dominated by two main peaks at 1000-800 and 600-490 Ma. Their epsilon(Hf(t)) values range from -20 to 10 (66% negative values), and - 15 to 5 (77% negative values), respectively. Therefore, well comparable age spectra and Hf isotopic compositions suggest a close linkage of South Tarim and North India in Gondwana. Additionally, our results also identify Mesoproterozoic basement rocks in the South Western Kunlun Terrane, southwestern Tarim. The 487 +/- 7 Ma andesitic lava sample with epsilon(Hf(t)) values clustering 10 to 15 formed during retreating subduction indicates that the northward subduction of the Proto-Tethys oceanic lithosphere initiated prior to 487 +/- 7 Ma},

   abstract = {The middle reach of the Yangtze River experienced significant drainage reorganization during the Mesozoic to Cenozoic tectonic evolution of South China. A continental-scale, westward-flowing axial river, or paleo-Middle Yangtze, formed following the Mesozoic collision between the North China and South China blocks. The river later flowed to the east as a result of the Cenozoic uplift of the Tibetan Plateau, but its reversal history remains largely unknown. Changes in detrital zircon U-Pb ages of Mesozoic to Cenozoic strata in the Three Gorges region identify a vital provenance shift in the sediments of the paleo-Middle Yangtze. Combined with paleocurrent measurements and petrography, our results indicate that the paleo-Middle Yangtze initially reversed during the late Cretaceous, followed by progressive westward capturing in the Eocene. This conclusion provides a paleogeographic explanation for the limited exposures of Upper Cretaceous to Cenozoic rocks in the Sichuan Basin and refutes the "drainage divide" hypothesis for the Three Gorges.},

   abstract = {The Simao block, which is the northern extension of the Indochina block, and the Yangtze block were amalgamated by the closure of a Paleo-Tethys branch ocean commonly referred to as the Ailaoshan ocean. The exact location of the suture between these two continental blocks has been contested. Some researchers believed that it is located within the Cenozoic Ailaoshan shear zone whereas other researchers thought that it is present > 50 km farther to the west. The detrital and inherited-xenocrystic zircons from Paleozoic sedimentary rocks and a Triassic granite dyke respectively in the Laowangzhai-Mojiang suspect terrane, which occurs between the two suggested locations for the same suture, show that neither of these previously suggested locations is accurate. The age distribution pattern of detrital and inherited-xenocrystic zircons from the Laowangzhai-Mojiang suspect terrane is similar to that of detrital zircons from the Simao-Indochina block but different from that of those from the Jianshui area in the western margin of the Yangtze block. This indicates that the Laowangzhai-Mojiang suspect terrane belongs to the Simao-Indochina block. The actual location of the suture between the Simao-Indochina and Yangtze blocks is suggested to superimpose the Ailaoshan late-Devonian to early-Carboniferous ophiolite belt within the suspect terrane. The new interpretation is also supported by Hf isotopes of detrital zircons from the related continental blocks. The age distribution pattern of Precambrian detrital zircons from the western part of the Yangtze block is different from that of those from Australia or Tethyan Himalaya (the northern part of the Indian continent), indicating that the Yangtze block was not an integral part of Australia or India in Rodinia. The age distribution pattern of pre-Carboniferous detrital zircons from the Simao-Indochina block is remarkably similar to that of those from the Tethyan Himalaya, indicating that the Simao-Indochina block was derived from Indian Gondwana.

   abstract = {The North China Craton (NCC) is bounded by two Paleozoic accretionary arc terranes: the North Qinling terrane to the south and the Bainaimiao terrane to the north. The timing of arc accretion to the NCC and the architecture of the Bainaimiao arc remain unclear. During the building and accretion of the arcs along its margins, the NCC experienced a long sedimentary hiatus since the Ordovician, which ended with the deposition of bauxite-bearing sediments in the Late Carboniferous. In this paper we report the U-Pb and Hf isotopes of detrital zircons from the Late Carboniferous bauxite layer and use these data to constrain the tectonic evolution of the margin of the NCC. The detrital zircons yield a minimumU-Pb age of ca. 310Ma and a prominent age peak at ca. 450Ma. Zircon crystalswith ages of ca. 330 Maand ca. 1900Ma aremore common in the bauxite samples fromthe northern part of the NCC than in those from the central part. The eHf(t) values of the ca. 450 Ma detrital zircon crystals of the bauxite samples fromthe NCC are similar to those of the contemporaneous detrital zircon crystals fromtheNorth Qinling arc terrane to the south, but different fromthose of the contemporaneous detrital zircon crystals fromthe Bainaimiao arc terrane to the north. The ca. 450Ma detrital zircon crystals in the ca. 310Ma bauxite deposits are therefore interpreted to have been derived from the North Qinling arc terrane. The source of the ca. 330 Ma detrital zircon crystals of the bauxite deposits is interpreted to be the northern margin of the NCC, where intermediate-felsic plutons formed at ca. 330 Ma are common. The results from this study support the interpretation that the Paleozoic continental arc terranes and their concomitant back-arc basins were developed along the margins of the NCC before ca. 450 Ma, and the arc complexes were subsequently accreted to the craton in the Late Carboniferous. This was then followed by the formation of a walled continental basin within the NCC. (C) 2015 International Association for Gondwana Research. Published by Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {The widespread Tibetan Permo-Carboniferous glaciogenic diamictites (PCGDs) are conventionally thought to be sourced from Indian Gondwana during glacier transport and deglaciation. However, the Lhasa PCGDs differ in detrital zircon U-Pb age spectra and epsilon(Hf)(t) values from those in Southern Qiangtang and Tethyan Himalaya. The similarities in epsilon(Hf)(t) values for similar-age detrital zircons, the development of glacier transport pathways, and the large volumes of the Tibetan PCGDs indicate an Australian source for the Lhasa PCDGs, and an Indian source for the Southern Qiangtang and Tethyan Himalayan PCDGs. We conclude that the Southern Qiangtang and Tethyan Himalayan are paleographically linked to northern India, whereas Lhasa is positioned adjacent to NW Australia during the Paleozoic. Magmatic and metamorphic records further indicate that eastern Lhasa (E90 degrees-E95 degrees) represents the outboard extension of events recorded in northern Central Australia, whereas western Lhasa (E80 degrees-E90 degrees) was located outboard of the West Australian Craton.},

In this study, LA-ICPMS U-Pb analyses of detrital zircon grains from two mesosomes in the migmatitic Dakendaban Group yield ages of 2467+28/-26 Ma and 2474+66/-52 Ma, respectively. Zircon grains from a leucosome give two distinct ages of 2471+18/-16 Ma and 1924+14/-15 Ma. Zircon from a granitic pegmatite that intruded into the Dakendaban Group yields an age of 2427+44/-38 Ma. These data suggest that the Early Paleoproterozoic Dakendaban Group deposited between similar to 2.43 to similar to 2.47 Ga and has been subject to an intrusive event at 2.43 Ga, and regional metamorphism-anatexis at 1.92 Ga. The common lower intercept age of similar to 0.9 Ga probably records a significant Early Neoproterozoic event in the Quanji Block.},

   abstract = {Two bauxite horizons, with a total reserve of 1.29 Bt, occur in the Lower Carboniferous and Lower Permian in the central South China Block. Different from other intracontinental bauxites in China, which are genetically linked to the orogenesis along the continental margin, these bauxites were generated in the absence of marginal orogenesis. The genesis of these bauxites were studied based on tectonic, paleogeographic, and paleoclimatic controls. The orebody in Huofengchong (HFC) region is hosted within the Lower Carboniferous, which overlies upon the Cambrian dolomite unconformably. The orebody in the regions of Yanfengba (YFB) and Baiyantou (BYT) occurs in Lower Permian, which overlies upon the Silurian shale or Devonian dolomite unconformably. The mineral assemblages in the Carboniferous HFC bauxite consist of diaspore, illite, anatase, and in Permian YFB and BYT bauxite, the minerals are diaspore, anatase, illite, clinochlore, and kaolinite. The data from the U-Pb isotope measurements of detrital zircons from these bauxites provide two main ages: (1) a maximum U-Pb age peak of ca. 800 Ma from the Carboniferous HFC and (2) a maximum age peak of ca. 1100 Ma for the Permian BYT and YFB. The ca. 800 Ma detrital zircons from the Carboniferous bauxite are dominating in the Paleozoic sedimentary units, which likely derive from the erosion of the Mid- to Neo-proterozoic felsic volcanic and intrusive rocks (Panxi-Hannan arc) occurring in the western margin of the South China Block. By contrast, the zircons with ages of ca. 1100 Ma are prevalent in the Paleozoic sediments from the center of the block. The above results indicate that the Lower Carboniferous and Lower Permian bauxites are sourced from the sedimentary rocks in the western and central parts of the South China Block, respectively. Despite the difference in the provenance, these two episodes of deposits were both deposited in a tidal fiat-restricted platform attached to an EW-trending Yangtze island, occupies the western to central parts of the South China block. This indicates that the shift from a marginal to central uplift within the paleo-island from Early Carboniferous to Early Permian has induced the transition in the provenance of the source material. In addition, the weathered materials from the two provenances both accumulated in the coastal region receiving further bauxitization. The bauxitization was boosted by the persistent preferable tepid and humid paleoclimate, defined by the equatorial position of South China block and the drop of global temperature during the metallogenic period.},

Greywacke from different tectonic slices in the Niujuanzi ophiolitic m,lange were analyzed for detrital zircon U-Pb geochronology, trace elements and whole-rock trace elements to infer their provenance and the evolution of the Niujuanzi Ocean. Sample N-76s containing Carboniferous spores has the youngest zircon age of 323 Ma, while sample N-85s without fossils has the youngest zircon age of 449 Ma. The two samples were deposited no earlier than 323 and 449 Ma, respectively. The greywackes are depleted in large ion lithophile elements, and are relatively enriched in high field strength elements. The age spectra and trace element concentrations indicate that the sediments may have been deposited near the trench. The Hf, U, and Yb contents of zircons from sample N-76s vary widely, whereas those from sample N-85s have a narrow range. Sample N-76s contains both continental and oceanic zircons, while sample N-85s contains only continental zircons. The sediments were derived from the continental arc and accretionary wedge. The Paleozoic oceanic crust zircons have ages of 430-500 Ma, indicating the timing of the expansion of the Hongliuhe-Niujuanzi-Xichangjing Ocean expansion. The oldest Paleozoic continental zircon has an age of 470 Ma, suggesting that the northward subduction of the oceanic crust may have started at that time.},

Zircon U-Pb data of siltstone samples and paleontological data indicate the Ayadeng Formation dates back to the Early Ordovician. Although its location is near the NCB, its zircon age spectra and paleontology share a closer affinity with those of Tarim and NE Gondwana, as the U-Pb data suggest an age range of 490-2 192 Ma (peak age=629, 788, 965 and 1 935 Ma), and similar gastropod fossils are found in Tarim and NE Gondwana. The U-Pb ages of meta-sandstone samples in the Xuniwusu Formation indicate a shared inheritance with the Ayadeng Formation (before 440 Ma), and the U-Pb ages of sandstone samples in the Xibiehe Formation are concentrated, with age peaks centered at ca. 420 Ma. Fossil corals occur in these two formations, and their age components also indicate a collisional setting. Therefore, it is speculated that the BAB drifted away from Tarim or NE Gondwana during the Ordovician and became attached to northern NCB between 440-420 Ma as an exotic terrane. During the Early Paleozoic, there may have occurred a collision between an arc and a continental block.},

   abstract = {The Paleozoic Baishuijiang Group is exposed in the southern Qinling belt and consists of turbidite sediments. The provenances of the Paleozoic sedimentary rocks is constrained by the integration of major and trace elements and detrital zircon U-Pb dating, which can help to understand the connection between the provenance and the Paleozoic tectonic evolution of the Qinling orogenic belt. The sandstones and mudstones have intermediate SiO2/Al2O3 and K2O/Na2O ratios, and high Fe2O3 + MgO contents. In comparison with average upper continental crust, they show strong negative Nb-Ta and Sr anomalies, slight depletion of Zr-Hf and Th, but moderate enrichment of Sc, Ni and Cr. These rocks show LREE enrichment, and pronounced negative Eu anomalies in chondrite-normalized REE patterns, similar to post-Archean shales. The weathering trend of the sandstones and mudstones suggests andesitic and granodioritic provenances. These sediments are geochemically similar to continental island arc sediments, and therefore were probably deposited at an active continental margin. Detrital zircon U-Pb dating of five sandstones from the Baishuijiang Group yielded ages ranging from 407 to 3000 Ma, with six peaks at ca. 425, 710, 780, 930, 1800, and 2500 Ma. The youngest age peak at 425 Ma and two zircon grains with a weighted average age of 414 Ma indicate that the maximum depositional age of the Baishuijiang Group is late Paleozoic. Our new age data thus suggest that these turbidite sediments were mainly derived from the northern Qinling belt and the northern margin of the Yangtze Block. We propose that the Paleozoic sediments were deposited in an ocean basin between the northern Qinling belt and the Yangtze Block. Combined with regional geological evidences, our results indicate that there was a paleo-ocean in the Qinling orogenic belt since Neoproterozoic era. The oceanic crust was continually sub-ducted northward, resulting in multiple accretion events from the early Paleozoic to early Triassic, which ultimately led to the amalgamation of the north China and Yangtze plates.

   abstract = {Upper Cretaceous to Eocene marine sedimentary sequences of the Yarlung-Tsangpo Suture Zone (YTSZ) provide critical constraints on the initial process of the India-Asia continental collision and the closure time of the Neo-Tethyan Ocean. New sedimentological, petrographic, biochronological and detrital zircon age data of Cretaceous-Palaeogene strata from the southern margin of the YTSZ are reported in this study. Detrital zircons from the Lower Cretaceous Gyabula Formation are dominated by Archean to Cambrian U-Pb ages, indicating a likely source originating from the Indian continent. In contrast, zircon ages from the Palaeogene Jiachala Formation are predominantly younger than 200 Ma, with a major peak of ca. 76-187 Ma, which is consistent with a source from either an intra-oceanic island arc system or the Asian continent. Sixty species of radiolarian fossils obtained from the Gyabula, Zongzhuo and Jiachala Formations provide a regional correlation with the Cretaceous Tethyan realm and Palaeogene low-latitude biozonation schemes based on the Unitary Association method. The Palaeogene radiolarian zonation UAZ JP10 identified in the Jiachala Formation, when combined with existing absolute age models derived from the Deep Sea Drilling Project and Ocean Drilling Program, indicates an age of ca. 61.8-61.1 Ma. Integration of the biochronological and detrital zircon age data suggests that major changes in provenance occurred at the Indian continental margin, allowing an important timing constraint on the onset of collision to be placed no later than the Danian at ca, 61.8 Ma. This study highlights the significance of focusing on distinct sedimentary sequences in collisional orogens to reconstruct the timing and processes of continental collision events.},

   abstract = {Researchers have long suspected a source-to-sink link between the Yangtze Block (and/or North China Block) and Eocene-Miocene passive margin strata in Taiwan, and various models have been proposed to explain similarities in provenance and the presence of Archean grains. The East China Sea Shelf Basin, whose evolution has been neglected in most models, resides between potential mainland China source regions and the sediment sink in Taiwan, and occupies the corridor through which sediment would have been transported. Here we present 378 new concordant detrital zircon U-Pb ages from the Oligocene Huagang formation in the Xihu Sag, eastern East China Sea Shelf Basin. We also present a compilation of published detrital zircon data from major rivers across mainland China to evaluate potential sediment source regions. Detrital zircons in the Huagang formation range in age from 330.4 to 284243Ma, with major clusters at 100-300 and 1,600-2,200Ma and small early-middle Paleozoic, Neoproterozoic, and Paleoproterozoic to Archean peaks. Visual and statistical comparison of age distributions suggest close relationships between the Min River and Eocene-Oligocene samples from western Taiwan and between the Oligocene Huagang formation and Miocene strata in western Taiwan. Combined with the tectonic and depositional evolution of the region, these observations suggest that Eocene-Oligocene sediments in Taiwan were mainly sourced from the Min River or similar drainage in the Cathaysia Block. However, the similarities between the Huagang formation and Miocene strata are best explained by reworking of the Oligocene sediment in the Xihu Sag and transportation to western Taiwain during Miocene tectonic inversion of the East China Sea Shelf Basin.},

   abstract = {Late Tonian to Cambrian sedimentary sequences in northwestern India and South China provide vital evidence for modeling their paleogeographic linkage, including their juxtaposition and subsequent separation during the transition from the Rodinia to the Gondwana supercontinents. Similarities in lithostratigraphy and detrital zircon U-Pb-Hf-O isotopic characteristics in the late Tonian sedimentary units from both regions underline a common provenance. A substantial decrease in zircon delta O-18 values from super- to sub-mantle compositions and simultaneous increase in the zircon epsilon(Hf(t)) values in South China and northwestern India for the 800-700 Ma time window suggest a common Neoproterozoic extensional magmatic event, corresponding with the Rodinia breakup. A distinct change in sedimentary provenance is noted during the Cryogenian period. Sedimentation along the northwestern margin of India for the remainder of the Neoproterozoic encompasses large volumes of clastic detritus dominated by old zircon ages, derived inboard from the Indian craton. In contrast, contemporaneous sedimentary units in the Yangtze region of South China are dominated by Neoproterozoic zircons. The detrital zircon age data underline a close paleogeographic linkage between northwestern India and South China (Yangtze and Cathaysia regions) in the Rodinia supercontinent configuration and argue for their separation through continental rifting during the Cryogenian. Northwestern India developed into a passive margin, whereas the South China block partially rifted, rotated, and migrated dextrally along the Gondwana margin toward northeastern India and Western Australia, such that the Cathaysia block continued to receive detritus from Gondwana continental regions.},

   abstract = {Neoproterozoic sedimentary sequences in the South China Block provide great opportunity to examine the tectonic evolution and crustal accretion during this period. This study presents U-Pb ages and Hf isotope composition of detrital zircons and Nd isotope composition of whole rocks of the Neoproterozoic sequences from the Yangtze Block, part of the South China Block. Age patterns of detrital zircons imply that the source area experienced three major periods of magmatic activity at 2,300-2,560, 1,900-2,100 and 770-1,000 Ma and two major episodes of juvenile crust accretion at 2,600-3,400 and 770-1,000 Ma. The maximum age of the Gucheng glaciation can be restricted at similar to 768 Ma from the youngest detrital zircon ages, probably corresponding to the Kaigas glaciation rather than to the Sturtian glaciation. High La/Sc ratio and low Cr/Th, Sc/Th and Co/Th ratios of the sedimentary rocks point to a derivation from dominantly felsic upper continental crustal sources, whereas large variation of epsilon(Nd)(t) and epsilon(Hf)(t) values indicates that mantle-derived magmatic rocks also provided material to the sedimentary sequences in different degrees. The shift in epsilon(Nd)(t) values of whole rocks and U-Pb age spectra of detrital zircons records the evolution from a back-arc to retro-arc foreland to a rift basin. Age distribution of detrital zircons from the Neoproterozoic sequences, compared with those of the major crustal blocks of Rodinia, implies that the position of the Yangtze Block was probably adjacent to northern India rather than between Australia and Laurentia before the breakup of the Rodinia supercontinent.},

   abstract = {The South China craton was formed by collision of the Yangtze and Cathaysia blocks during the Neoproterozoic Jiangnan orogeny (also termed the Jingnin or Sibao orogeny in Chinese literature). Basement rocks within the Yangtze block consist mainly of Proterozoic sediments of the Lengjiaxi and Banxi groups. U-Pb ages of detrital zircons obtained by the laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry dating technique imply that the deposition of the Lengjiaxi Group continued until the Neoproterozoic. The youngest detrital zircons suggest a minimum deposition age of similar to 830 Ma for the Lengjiaxi Group and an initial deposition age of 785 +/- 12 Ma for the Banxi Group, indicating a temporal hiatus of 48 +/- 13 Ma between these Neoproterozoic sedimentary rocks distributed in northwestern Hunan Province, South China craton. Detrital zircons from both the Lengjiaxi and Banxi groups have a wide range of epsilon(Hf) (t) values from -12 to 14.2 and a continuous Nd and Hf model age spectrum from similar to 820 Ma to 2200 Ma. Model ages of many detrital zircon grains reach up to ca. 2.9-3.5 Ga, indicating that both juvenile mantle material and ancient crust provided sedimentary detritus. This is also consistent with the Nd isotopic signature of sedimentary rocks recorded in the Lengjiaxi Group, suggesting a back-arc tectonic setting. The Banxi Group has slightly enriched Nd isotopic signatures relative to the Lengjiaxi Group, implying a higher percentage of old continental material in the sedimentary source. Combined with previously published data, new results help us to reconstruct the Neoproterozoic tectonic evolution of the South China craton.},

   abstract = {A major challenge in provenance and source-to-sink analysis is deciphering intrabasinal versus extrabasinal sediment sources and processes. This issue is well-illustrated by the Paleogene Pearl River Mouth Basin (PRMB), whose provenance reflects a combination of sediments eroded from the Cathaysia Block (CB), southeastern China, and from intrabasinal structural highs. Here we use new detrital zircon U-Pb ages from Paleogene formations in seven boreholes, southern PRMB, to investigate such local versus regional influences on provenance. Detrital zircons from the upper Eocene-lower Oligocene Enping Formation are dominated by Jurassic-Cretaceous ages, with a 125-110 Ma age-cluster, absent in modem river data from the CB and diagnostic of intrabasinal sediment sources. In the northern part of the basin, Mesozoic-dominated zircon age-spectra give way to Paleozoic and Precambrian grains, a pattern also recognized for the late Oligocene Zhuhai Formation, suggesting a major change in provenance likely related to extrabasinal influence from the CB. The age spectra for these samples are most similar to the northeastern Pearl River, narrowing this region as the most likely source. Spatial analysis of the results suggests that during deposition of the Enping Formation, sediment transport was not uniform and that the basin's architecture strongly influenced provenance, with structural highs acting as both sediment sources and barrier to sediment transport from the CB; whereas structural lows, with clear extrabasinal influence, functioned as sediment transport corridors. Such spatial differences are lost in samples from the Zhuhai Formation and their provenance suggests that the paleo-Pearl River and tectono-climatically driven surface processes in the CB dominated deposition thereafter.

   abstract = {Paleogene syn-rift successions in the South China Sea are poorly understood and systematic provenance analysis, which could provide clues to their history, is lacking. Here we report 409 new concordant U-Pb ages from detrital zircons separated from the Paleogene Wenchang, Enping, and Zhuhai formations in the Zhu 1 depression, Pearl River Mouth Basin. The new data, combined with the published age data from the region, document changes in the provenance of syn-rift successions. Detrital zircons from the Eocene Wenchang Formation are unimodal, with Jurassic-Cretaceous (180-80 Ma) ages making up >80% of grains. The ages are consistent with the geochronology of intrabasinal highs, dominated by igneous rocks emplaced during the Yanshanian orogeny, and suggest local provenance. By contrast, detrital zircons from the upper Eocene to lower Oligocene Enping Formation form three well-recognized age-clusters, with peaks at 150, 254, and 438 Ma that match documented tectonomagmatism in South China Block (SCB). Combined with increasing numbers of Precambrian zircons, the data suggest increasing influence of regional provenance of the SCB. Similar age peaks are also recognized from the limited number of zircons analyzed from the upper Oligocene Zhuhai Formation and comparability with modern shelf and river sediment indicates the unit was mainly sourced from the SCB and likely transported by a paleo-Pearl River. We infer that the change in provenance, from local uplifts within the Zhu 1 to the SCB, is related to distinct phases of PRMB rift development; however, later changes are best explained by SCB drainage evolution.},

New zircon U-Pb ages, in combination with previous fossil data, indicate the lower and upper Louziba Groups were deposited between 655 and 635 Ma (Cryogenian) and 635 and 542 Ma (Ediacaran), respectively. Low CIA (65-57) and high ICV (1.64-1.05) values for the Louziba sandstones are suggestive of immature sediments that experienced mild to weak chemical weathering in their source areas. In contrast, early Paleozoic sandstones have higher CIA (80-69) and lower ICV (0.95-0.84) values, indicative of mature sediments with intensive chemical weathering. Despite the different degrees of chemical weathering, all sedimentary samples show positive correlation between TiO2 and Al2O3, and negative correlation in plot of (La/Yb)n vs Zr but lack any correlation between (La/Yb)n and P2O5. These data demonstrate sorting of resistant minerals, such as rutile, monazite and zircon, did not affect the chemical signatures of sampled detritus. Consequently, geochemical features, in combination with detrital age spectra, indicate that the Louziba Group and overlying sequences record sedimentation in collisional and passive settings, with the detritus being derived dominantly from intermediate to felsic igneous rocks. Late Mesoproterozoic (ca.1300-1000 Ma) detritus in the lower Louziba Group were probably derived primarily from the Windmill Islands-Bunger Hills (1300-1050 Ma) and Albany-Fraser Belt-Musgrave (1300-1050 Ma) regions in East Antarctica-western Australia. Increasing input of early Neoproterozoic (similar to 990-950 Ma) detritus in the uppermost Louziba Group indicates a greater contribution from the Eastern Ghats (ca. 990-950 Ma) in eastern India and North Prince Charles Mountains (ca. 990-950 Ma) in East Antarctica. This source change was synchronous with the formation of the Kuunga (560-530 Ma) and Pinjarra (560-520 Ma) Orogens during assembly of Gondwana. The sediments of the Huanglian Formation of the uppermost Louziba Group likely recorded this event. Overlying Paleozoic sequences then were deposited on passive margin with detritus being derived dominantly from an early Neoproterozoic source, e.g., eastern India and East Antarctica.

   abstract = {Metamorphosed clastic rocks provide important constrains on the composition of upper continental crust. Here we report and characterize a sequence of Neoarchean paragneiss in association with migmatite from the Qixingtai area in Western Shandong Province (WSP) in the North China Craton (NCC), that represent metamorphosed moderate- to fine-grained clayey clastic rocks. The garnet from the paragneiss is characterized by nil or weakly compositional zoning. The biotite shows low TiO2 content (<2 wt.%) and high Fe/[Fe + Mg] molar ratios (0.45-0.48). The P-T estimates suggest that the paragneiss sequence was metamorphosed at 5.5-5.7 kbar and 678-679 degrees C. The detrital zircons from the sillimanite garnet gneiss yield concordant Pb-207/Pb-206 ages from 2.78 to 2.53 Ga (discordance <= 15%), suggesting that the protolith sediments were deposited after 2.53 Ga. The overgrowth rims on the detrital zircons of the paragneiss and those from the leucosome of the migmatite show similar low Th/U values, moderate Th and high U and common lead contents, indicating that the metamorphic and anatectic zircons formed under fluid-rich conditions. The intrusive contact between the massive monzogranite and the banded migmatite suggests that the regional metamorphic/anatectic event occurred before the emplacement of the monzogranite. However, the upper intercept ages, defined by the overgrowth rims of the pre-existing zircons from the leucosome, are broadly similar to those of the crystallization of the magmatic zircons from the monzogranite within errors at similar to 2.50 Ga. The paragneiss exhibits SiO2 contents in the range of similar to 58 wt.% (garnet gneiss)-similar to 70 wt.% (sillimanite gneiss), and negative correlations with Al2O3 (23.4-15.4 wt.%), TiO2 (0.90-0.35 wt.%), MgO (4.5-1.1 wt.%), FeOt (8.3-2.6 wt.%) and Cr (382-131 ppm). The REE patterns also show a systematic change from garnet gneiss to sillimanite gneiss. In trace element discrimination diagrams, the paragneiss plots between the end-members of komatiite/basalt and TTG/granite, suggesting that the sediments sourced from a mixture of ultramafic-mafic and felsic protoliths. Combined with the geochronological data, we suggest that the 2.75-2.71 Ga komatiite-tholeiite sequence of the Taishan association and TTGs in the central terrane and the 2.56-2.53 Ga Tits in the southwestern part of the WSP as the potential provenance for the clastics. The protolith of the paragneiss in the Qixingtai area belong to the sedimentary sequence of the Taishan association. Spatially associated coeval arc-like assemblage and other geological evidence suggest that, (1) the metasediments were likely deposited in a back arc basin, (2) the upper amphibolites-facies metamorphism, constrained by the mineral assemblages in the paragneiss, might be related to the closure of the basin, and (3) the generation of large volumes of matured K-rick continental crust occurred not earlier than 2.53 Ga in the WSP granite-greenstone belt.

The 1524 Ma, 834 Ma and 763 Ma U-Pb ages of detrital zircons for here investigated Tianli Schists, Liuyuan and Wengjialing sandstone constrain the maximum depositional ages for the respective sedimentary protoliths. Considerable time lag between onset of sedimentation and the age of source rocks suggests that the sedimentary protolith of the Tianli Schists received detritus from a wide range of cratonic sources in a tectonically passive scenario, as indicated by their elevated Zr/Sc ratios. Extraneous source for the 2700-2600 Ma detritus indicates that the sedimentary protolith for the Tianli Schists itself was deposited in a basin that received detritus from the Yangtze Block during the fragmentation of the Columbia/Nuna supercontinent. On the other hand, profuse syn-sedimentary magmatic (804-849 Ma) detritus for the Liuyuan sandstone indicates a continental arc setting, also supported by the La-Th-Sc and Th-Co-Zr signatures. The Wengjialing Formation and its equivalents were deposited in a continental rift basin, coeval with the breakup of Rodinia supercontinent, with addition of newly formed arc related rocks (>= 820 Ma) and syn-rifting magmatic rocks (810-760 Ma) as the predominant sources. These features provide substantial evidence for the paleogoegraphic reconstructions of the southeastern Yangtze Block within the Proterozoic supercontinent configurations.},

The Danzhou Group contains dominant Neoproterozoic detrital zircon grains (similar to 740-900 Ma) with two major age groups at similar to 740-790 Ma and similar to 810-830 Ma, suggesting the detritus was largely sourced from the widely distributed Neoproterozoic igneous plutons within the Yangtze Block. The sedimentary rocks from the lower Danzhou Group, including sandstones, siltstone and pelitic rocks, have UCC-like chemical signatures, representing mixed products of primary sources. The upper Danzhou Group received more recycled materials because the rocks have relatively higher Zr/Sc ratios, Hf contents and a greater influx of Pre-Neoproterozoic zircons. All of the rocks have high La/Sc, low Sc/Th and Co/Th ratios, consistent with sources dominantly composed of granitic to dioritic end-members from the western and northwestern Yangtze Block. Chemical compositions do not support significant contributions of mafic components. Most Neoproterozoic zircons have positive epsilon(Hf(t)) (0-17) indicative of sediments derived mainly from the western and northwestern Yangtze Block. The uni-modal Neoproterozoic zircons and felsic igneous source rocks for the Danzhou Group suggest that the Yangtze Block was an independent continent in the peripheral part of Rodinia.

   abstract = {The Paleoproterozoic to Mesoproterozoic (1742-1503 Ma) Dongchuan Group in the southwestern Yangtze Block is a rift-related sedimentary sequence that was associated with the breakup of the supercontinent Columbia and is particularly important for the possible linkage between the Yangtze Block and other continents in Columbia. The Dongchuan Group consists of the Yinmin, Luoxue, Etouchang and Luzhijiang formations from the base upward. Sandstones from the Yinmin Formation are mainly arkose containing dominant K-feldspar with subordinate plagioclase and quartz. Abundant feldspar and high Qm/Q ratios (0.94-1) are indicative of plutonic sources. These sandstones have high La/Sc (3.06 to 432), low Sc/Th (0.74 to 1.15) and Co/Th (0.85 to 1.52) and highly evolved Nd isotopes (epsilon(Nd(t)) = -6.2 to -8.2), consistent with an old, felsic igneous source. Detrital zircons of this formation have two major age groups at 2602-2887 Ma and 2224-2392 Ma. Siltstones of the Etouchang Formation have detrital zircons with a prominent age peak at similar to 2560 Ma and several subordinate peaks at similar to 2180 Ma, similar to 2100 Ma and similar to 1900 Ma. They have high Sc/Th (1.00-7.08), Co/Th (0.13 to 6.31) and epsilon(Nd(t)) (-2.1 to -6.7), significantly different from the Yinmin Formation. The Yinmin Formation is interpreted to deposit during the initial stage of extensional rifting receiving detritus of granites and TTG mainly from uplifted shoulder. The Etouchang Formation more likely formed in a passive margin with sedimentary material largely from cratonic sources. Paleoproterozoic to Mesoproterozoic rift basins in the southwestern Yangtze Block, north Australia and northwestern Laurentia have remarkably similar provenance and tectonic setting in their lower part (1742-1596 Ma), but significantly different since the onset of the Etouchang Formation (ca. 1596 Ma). Therefore, the southwestern Yangtze Block was likely connected with the north Australia and northwestern Laurentia in Columbia and drifted away from these continents on or before ca. 1596 Ma.

   abstract = {The Sibao Group on the southeastern margin of the Yangtze Block of South China is composed mainly of flysch turbidites up to ca. 4000 m thick. Sandstones from the Sibao Group have intermediate to high SiO2 (58.6-80.0 wt%, average 68.2 wt%) and Al2O3 wt% (7.4-20.6 wt%, average 15 wt%), typical of immature lithic varieties. Both sandstones and mudstones contain high K2O (1.41-6.28 wt%) but extremely low Na2O (0.03-1.49 wt%). Positive correlations between Al2O3 and Fe2O3(T), TiO2, MgO and K2O, significant depletion of Ca, Na and Sr relative to upper continental crust and high PIA and pre-metasomatism CIA values suggest that intensive chemical weathering of the source area. Variable Cr/Th (3.9-37.0) and Co/Th (0.2-3.2) ratios indicate a source with predominant felsic and minor mafic components. Discrimination diagrams involving Ti, Al, Fe, La, Th, Sc, Hf and Co reveal the source with multiple lithologies consisting mainly of TM-like, granitic, andesitic and felsic volcanic rocks. Predominant detrital zircons have Neoproterozoic ages from 822 to 980 Ma, whereas the remaining zircons define two age groups at 1.35-2.22 Ga and 2.32-2.86 Ga. Twenty-six of the youngest grains have a weighted mean age of 835.3 +/- 3.6 Ma, tentatively interpreted as the maximum depositional age of the Sibao Group. Neoproterozoic zircon grains have variable Hf-177/Hf-176 ratios (0.281194 to 0.282564) and epsilon(Hf(t)) values (-35.9 to 9.8), indicative of the involvement of juvenile and ancient recycled components. The 1.4 and 1.8 Ga zircon grains have variable Hf-177/Hf-176 ratios (0.280947-0.281874), probably reflecting the growth of the supercontinent Columbia and suggesting that the Yangtze Block was separated from Columbia as an independent terrane at around 1.4 Ga. The complicated provenance involving felsic to intermediate rocks and Neoproterozoic juvenile to Neoarchean mature materials suggests that the Neoproterozoic Sibao Group was deposited in a back-arc foreland basin related to the northward (present coordinate) subduction of an oceanic lithosphere beneath the southeastern Yangtze Block.

   abstract = {The Jiangnan Fold Belt in the South China Block has been traditionally assumed to be Mesoproterozoic in age and related to the global Grenville orogeny. Sedimentary successions in the Jiangnan Fold Belt archive direct record of tectonic evolution; however, they have not yet been evaluated properly. The Lushan massif, comprising Kangwanggu and Xingzi groups, is the major basement complex in the Jiangnan Belt. Regional correlation of these two groups is poorly constrained, such as with the Shuangqiaoshan group, and thus their role in the regional tectonic evolution is not clear. Detrital zircon U-Pb ages suggest that the Xingzi and Kangwanggu groups were deposited at 820-810 and ca. 830 Ma, respectively. They are composed of dominantly felsic to intermediate volcanic detritus, as indicated by the relatively high Th/Cr (0.24-0.06) ratios and radiogenic Nd isotopes (epsilon(Nda(t)) values = +1.5 to -2.9) of the sedimentary rocks. An overwhelming abundance of Neoproterozoic (ca. 860-810 Ma) angular, detrital zircon grains in both the groups indicates derivation chiefly from locally distributed syn-sedimentary igneous rocks. A predominance of zircons with ages close to the time of deposition implies a convergent plate margin setting for Kangwanggu and Xingzi groups. Geochemical signatures, such as La-Th-Co and Th-Sc-Zr/10 plots for Xingzi and Kangwanggu sedimentary rocks also underline tectonically active settings, consistent with the arc affinity of the associated mafic and felsic volcanic rocks. In contrast to the dominant Neoproterozoic detritus in the Kangwanggu sandstone, argillaceous rocks of the Xingzi group received additional input of pre-Neoproterozoic detritus. Moreover, the Xingzi argillaceous rocks have epsilon(Nd(t)) values (+0.9 to -2.9) slightly lower than those of the Kangwanggu sandstones (+1.5 to 0.0), indicating contribution from mature crustal materials exposed during progressive uplift of continental basement during orogenesis. These features suggest the Kangwanggu and Xingzi groups' record in a convergent continental margin environment during the formation of the Jiangnan Fold Belt. Persistence of the back-arc basin until ca. 811 Ma suggests that the South China Block occupied a peripheral position in the configuration of the Rodinia supercontinent. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

   abstract = {Precambrian sedimentary sequences in the eastern Jiangnan Orogen, South China, include the Neoproterozoic Shuangqiaoshan and Xikou Groups and the overlying Nanhua Sequence. U-Pb ages of detrital zircons provide tight constraints on the deposition of the Shuangqiaoshan and Xikou Groups at 831-815 Ma and 833-817 Ma, respectively. Rocks from the lower parts of these strata contain dominantly Neoproterozoic detritus with a pronounced age peak at 830-850 Ma, interpreted to be derived from a magmatic arc that has been mostly eroded. This magmatic arc was associated with sedimentation characterized by compositionally immature sediments with dominant early-Neoproterozoic (similar to 860-810 Ma) zircons that have variable epsilon(Hf(t)) values of -21.5 to 14.8. The upper parts of these strata, uncomfortably underlain by the low units, are molasse-type assemblages with additional input of pre-Neoproterozoic detritus, representing sediments accumulated in a retro-arc foreland basin associated with the Jiangnan Orogen. Combining four samples from the Nanhua Sequence, three major magmatic activities at 2.50-2.35 Ga, 2.10-1.90 Ga and 980-810 Ma in the source areas are identified. The older two events are characterized by reworking of pre-existing continental crust. Grenville magmatism and juvenile crust were insignificant in the eastern Jiangnan Orogen. Neoproterozoic zircons reflect generation of juvenile crust at 980-860 Ma, involvement of both juvenile and recycled materials at 860-810 Ma and reworking of pre-existing crust at 805-750 Ma, corresponding to island arc, continental magmatic arc and post-collisional rifting stages in the eastern Jiangnan Orogen.

   abstract = {Sedimentological and zircon U-Pb-Hf isotopic analyses of the Carboniferous strata in the Bainaimiao arc belt (BAB) provide provenance information for the northern margin of the North China Craton (NCC). The late Carboniferous strata in the eastern BAB were dominantly shallow marine carbonate-clastic deposits. Detrital zircon data show that: (1) sandstone from lower Sidaozhangpeng Formation displays two major age peaks of 369 Ma and 2522 Ma, with epsilon(Hf) (t) values of - 25.9 to - 20.4 and 2.2-6.4, respectively; (2) sandstone from upper Sidaozhangpeng Formation shows a significant age peak at 384 Ma, with epsilon(Hf) (t) values of - 25.3 to - 14.5. Determination of detrital zircon parent rock types based on trace element proxies suggests that the protolith rock types consist of felsic (73%) and mafic rocks (22%), with minor alkaline rocks (5%), implying a continental arc setting. The U-Pb-Hf dating of the Carboniferous strata in the western and eastern BAB shows different provenances: the Carboniferous sediments in the western BAB were derived from early Paleozoic magmatic rocks, micro-block (Hunshandake Block) and the NCC basement; the provenances of the Carboniferous strata from the eastern BAB were mainly local Devonian magmatic rocks, with subordinate input of the Neoarchean NCC basement rocks. The early Paleozoic zircon grains recorded by the early Devonian rhyolitic tuff and late Carboniferous sandstone indicate that the early Paleozoic arc magmatic activities also occurred in the eastern BAB.},

   abstract = {Loess deposits are important archives of past climate change in subtropical China, where long-term terrestrial records are scarce. However, only a few long-term records with reliable dating were reported in Jiangsu Province, where loess deposits in southeastern China were first discovered and designated as the Xiashu Loess. Moreover, the provenance of the Xiashu Loess is still controversial. This study presents the magnetostratigraphy and detrital zircon U-Pb age results of loess deposits at Zhoujiashan in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province. To date, this section (with basal age of approximately 0.88 Ma) may be the oldest loess deposits discovered in southeastern China. Based on the detrital zircon U-Pb ages of the Zhoujiashan section, together with published results of geochemistry, geomorphology, sedimentology, and meteorology, we propose that the Xiashu Loess has two mixed sources. Local materials derived from the Yangtze River Basin (including exposed river/lake beds, floodplains, and mountains) served as a major contributor. The distal eolian dust that originated from the arid areas of North China (including deserts, piedmont alluvial fans, and drylands) played a minor role in the formation process of the Xiashu Loess. The nearly synchronous onset age (approximately 0.88-0.85 Ma) of the Xiashu Loess was attributed to a regional environmental event during the middle Pleistocene transition.},

   abstract = {The Linxi Formation is widely deposited in eastern Inner Mongolia (NE China), especially along northern parts of the Solonker-Xar Moron Suture (SXMS) in the eastern Central Asian Orogenic Belt, yet its depositional age and provenance remain ambiguous. We studied the petrography, geochronology, and Hf isotopes of two sandstone samples from this formation, and estimated the depositional age and the provenance of the Linxi Formation, and further constrained the evolution of the Paleo-Asian Ocean (PAO). Based on detailed field observations and measurements, we. Zircons from rocks of the Linxi Formation are mainly composed of detrital zircons of magmatic origin. The determined ages of detrital zircons range from 233 +/- 2 Ma to 1365 +/- 14 Ma, and indicate that the provenance of the Linxi Formation experienced at least four tectonic-thermal events between 1365 and 233 Ma: Neoproterozoic (ca. 1365-543 Ma), Early Palaeozoic (ca. 512-426 Ma), Late Palaeozoic (ca. 418-251 Ma), and Early Mesozoic (ca. 249-233 Ma). The youngest detrital zircon, with a U-Pb age of 233 +/- 2 Ma, defines the maximum depositional age of the Linxi Formation. The epsilon(Hf) (t) values of dated zircons from the sandstone samples have a large range (-7.8-15.0). The four dominant age groups and the range in epsilon(Hf) (t) values are widely found in the Xing'an Block and Songnen-Zhangguangcai Range, which imply that the source of the Linxi Formation had an affinity with northeastern China. These data together with previous geochronological data (from west to east along the SXMS) on the crystallization and depositional ages of detrital zircon suggest that the Linxi Formation was deposited in different tectonic settings: convergent, collisional, and extensional. This study provides further evidence and constraints for the non-synchronous closure of the PAO.

   abstract = {y The strata of the Linxi Formation (LXF) occupy an extensive area of eastern Inner Mongolia, NE China and have close spatial and genetic relationships with important Mesozoic Sn-Cu-Pb-Zn-Ag veins and porphyry polymetallic deposits (ores). The rock types of the LXF include sandstone, siltstone and shale. Major and trace element (including rare earth element) data for rocks from the LXF in the Hanmiao area indicate that these rocks have a greywacke protolith derived from intermediate to acidic arc igneous rocks and were deposited during intensive tectonic activity. Laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry U-Pb dating of detrital zircons from sandstones in the LXF yields ages of 985 +/- 10 to 242 +/- 2 Ma. The youngest population of ages shows a peak at c. 258 Ma, suggesting that the main period of deposition of the LXF was in the late Permian. These ages, together with the youngest zircon age (c. 242 Ma), suggest that the deposition of the LXF mainly occurred during the late Permian and extended to the early Triassic. According to the results of the analysis of 44 sandstone and siltstone samples, ore elements (e.g. W, Sn, Ag and Mo) are significantly enriched in the LXF in this region. Combined with the fact that increasing numbers of polymetallic deposits have been discovered within the LXF strata in the southern Great Xing'an Range, we conclude that the strata of the LXF may be the source bed of the ore and there is potential for ore prospecting in the polymetallic deposits of the LXF in the Great Xing'an Range.},

   abstract = {Widespread Paleoproterozoic supracrustal rocks in the Trans-North China Orogen (TNCO) contain important information for the tectonic evolution of the North China Craton (NCC). Here, we report new in situ LA-ICP-MS detrital zircon U-Pb ages, Lu-Hf isotopic data, and whole-rock geochemical data for the Yejishan Group in the Ltiliang Complex. The group is a well-preserved volcanic-sedimentary assemblage and can be subdivided into the Qingyangshuwan. Bailongshan, and Chengdaogou formations from bottom up. The Bailongshan Formation consists dominantly of meta-basalts interbedded with several layers of clastic rocks, and the other two formations are composed exclusively of sedimentary rocks. In this study, samples of fourteen clastic rocks and thirteen basalts from the Yejishan Group were collected for measurements based on detailed fieldwork. Detrital zircon U-Pb dating of six clastic samples from the three formations display similar age distributions and give youngest ages between ca. 1870 and 1988 Ma. The youngest age peak of 1870 Ma obtained from the Qingyangshuwan Formation is regarded as the maximum depositional age of the Yejishan Group for the first time. The ca. 1779 Ma mafic dyke intruding into the Yejishan Group constrains the depositional age between 1870 and 1779 Ma. Clastic interlayer in the Bailongshan basalts has a youngest age peak of ca. 1988 Ma, suggesting that the basalts should erupt after 1988 Ma. The time constraint of the Bailongshan basalts in this study disapproves the previous view that the Bailongshan Formation should be removed from the Yejishan Group and assigned to the Luliang Group. According to the geochemical features, the Yejishan clastic rocks had a chemical immature source mixed of felsic and basaltic magmatic rocks with weak weathering, and suggestive of an active tectonic setting. The basalts show variable LREE enrichment, prominent Nb-Ta, Ti, P anomalies, probably derived from a subcontinental lithospheric mantle metasomatized by subduction-related fluids. Taken together the geochemical and chronological data, we propose that the Yejishan Group were formed in an active continental marginal basin at ca. 1870-1780 Ma. The conclusion is consistent with model of the ca. 1850 Ma collision in the TNCO. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {We report here the first integrated U-Pb dating and hafnium-oxygen isotope analyses of detrital zircon grains from sedimentary and volcaniclastic rocks in the Neoproterozoic Nanhua Basin, central South China. These data provide vital information on the depositional cycles of the Cryogenian strata and their bearings on the breakup of the Rodinia supercontinent, and the characteristics of Precambrian crustal growth in the South China Block and neighboring continents. Zircon SIMS U-Pb ages indicate that the Qingshuijiang Formation was deposited at 772 +/- 5 Ma and the Fanzhao Formation was deposited between 800 and 770 Ma. The onset time of the Sturtian (Jiangkou) glaciation is constrained to be no older than 730 Ma. Together with compilations of all available high precision zircon U-Pb data on tuff beds in the Nanhua Basin, our work demonstrates that the Cryogenian deposition in South China began at about 850 Ma and had three depositional cycles at ca. 850-820 Ma, 820-720 Ma and 720-635 Ma. Hf isotope analyses and U-Pb dating, combined with existing O isotope analyses, of detrital zircon have revealed three striking features for grains with 1.0-0.7 Ga ages: (1) about 22% of total analysed grains have Hf isotope compositions that plot between the new continental crust and depleted mantle growth curves; (2) about 80% of zircon grains have delta O-18 values below 6.5 parts per thousand; and (3) 950-700 Ma is the most dominant age group in the total of 1616 concordant detrital zircon ages from the Cryogenian sedimentary rocks. The Early Neoproterozoic (1.0-0.7 Ga) thus appears to have witnessed significant juvenile crustal growth in South China. In addition, zircon analyses of the Cryogenian sedimentary rocks revealed 3.2-2.9 Ga and possibly 2.7-2.4 Ga as two additional episodes of juvenile crust growth in South China and neighboring continents.

   abstract = {In order to understand how Late Mesoproterozoic to Early Neoproterozoic orogenic belts evolved during the assembly and rifting of the supercontinent Rodinia, we have carried out detailed studies on the geochemical compositions of Early Neoproterozoic crust across the Jiangnan orogen (JO) which connects the Yangtze and Cathaysia blocks on the northwestern margin of Rodinia. A gradual geochemical variation is recognized from east to west, based on comparisons of whole-rock Nd isotopes, U-Pb age spectra of detrital zircons, and Hf isotopes in magmatic zircons and detrital zircons from the Neoproterozoic granitoids and metasedimentary basement sequences in the JO. LA-ICP-MS U-Pb dating of detrital zircons from the sediments and magmatic zircons from interlayered volcanic rocks suggests that the folded basement sequences formed within the span 860-825 Ma, implying the final amalgamation of the Yangtze and Cathaysia blocks occurred no older than ca 825 Ma. The 950-820 Ma detrital zircons strongly dominate in the eastern basement sequences, and most of them show moderately to highly positive epsilon(Hf)(t). In contrast, many of the Early Neoproterozoic detrital zircons in the western JO have moderately negative epsilon(Hf)(t) and more older (>1.0 Ga) detrital zircons were found in this area. We suggest that the metasedimentary basement sequences in the JO were deposited in retro-arc foreland basins which originally evolved from back-arc basins, and the change of provenance controlled the variation in crustal geochemistry of crust across the JO. Sediments in the eastern basement sequences have been sourced mainly from the juvenile subduction-related igneous rocks to the east, with a few from the central Yangtze Block, whereas those in the western JO may have been located far from arc terranes to the east and thus received more older recycled detritus from the southern part of the South China Block. Moreover, the Hf isotopes of the detrital zircons imply episodic crustal growth in the provenance of the JO rnetasedimentary basement sequences, with age peaks at 1.0-0.8 Ga, 1.75-1.50 Ga and 2.60-2.45 Ga. The early crust in South China may have been formed mainly at around 3.8 Ga ago, and contains some Hadean components (ca 4.1 Ga). (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Extensive angular unconformities that occur across the Tianshan Orogen provide insight into the Paleozoic tectonic evolution of the southwestern Central Asian Orogenic Belt. This study presents new geochronological and geochemical data to unravel the age and origin of a pronounced angular unconformity in the Baluntai domain of the Chinese Western Tianshan. The angular unconformity separates a ductilely deformed metamorphic complex from overlying unmetamorphosed sequences. Detrital zircon age spectra suggest that the sedimentary samples received detritus from both the Precambrian basement and contemporaneous igneous rocks in the Central Tianshan and Yili blocks. The youngest detrital and metamorphic zircons in metasediments from the metamorphic complex reveal that their protoliths were deposited at ca. 419 Ma, and subsequently overprinted by metamorphism and ductile deformation at ca. 409 Ma. Along with ca. 532-407 Ma metavolcanics and foliated intrusions, the metamorphic complex constitutes a diachronous stratigraphic unit deposited during early Cambrian to late Silurian times, rather than a Precambrian basement as previously thought. The youngest detrital zircon age data from siliciclastic samples immediately above the angular unconformity constrain their deposition to ca. 407-397 Ma. In conjunction with a ca. 406 Ma rhyolitic tuff in the lower terrestrial siliciclastic unit and an early Carboniferous paleontological age of carbonates in the upper shallow-marine unit, it is suggested that the overlying unmetamorphosed sequences were accumulated during the early Devonian to the early Carboniferous. Thus, the angular unconformity in the Baluntai domain was formed between ca. 409 and 407 Ma. New and already published geochemical data reveal that the early Paleozoic (ca. 530-410 Ma) and late Paleozoic (ca. 410-320 Ma) igneous rocks are mainly medium- to high-K calc-alkaline I-type granitoids, which exhibit typical subduction-related geochemical signatures despite contrasting structural features. These geochronological and geochemical results are in accordance with those of similar early Devonian angular unconformities and Paleozoic igneous rocks in the southern Yili Block. The early Paleozoic igneous rocks display highly scattered zircon epsilon(Hf )(t) values, while the late Paleozoic rocks show a progressively increasing trend toward more positive values, attributed to slab rollback of the northward subducting South Tianshan Ocean under the Yili and Central Tianshan blocks. Thus, we propose that the formation of the angular unconformity was caused by tectonic conversion from contraction to extension due to slab rollback during the early Devonian. This study highlights the significance of geological and geochronological investigations of angular unconformities in the context of associated episodic magmatism and slab behavior in order to unravel distinct tectonic processes in the long-lived accretionary evolution of the Chinese Western Tianshan.},

   abstract = {The Hefei Basin of eastern China developed in response to uplift of the Dabie Orogen, and zircon dating can be used to assess the exhumation history of the orogen. Zircons were collected from samples of the Lower Jurassic Fanghushan Formation and Middle Jurassic Sanjianpu Formation in the southern Hefei Basin, and mica-quartz schist and biotite granite gneiss from the Susong Complex of the Dabie Orogen. The zircon U-Pb dating was undertaken using laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. The detrital zircons from conglomerates of the Fanghushan Formation and from clasts within the conglomerates have age-frequency distributions with the main clusters between 2.0 and 1.8 Ga, similar to age data of the Susong Complex. On the other hand, the zircons of the Fanghushan Formation do not show the age cluster at 1000-900 Ma that characterizes zircons in the underlying metasediments of the lower Paleozoic Foziling Group. A cluster of Triassic zircon ages also appears in the arkosic sandstones of the Fanghushan Formation. These data indicate that the provenance of the Fanghushan Formation was a mixture of high-pressure (HP) and ultrahigh-pressure (UHP) Triassic metamorphic rocks, Paleozoic magmatic rocks, and the Susong Complex, but not the lower Paleozoic Foziling Group even though it directly underlies the sediments of the Hefei Basin. Two samples from the Sanjianpu Formation show zircon age clusters at 797 and 791 Ma (middle Neoproterozoic) and 226 Ma (Triassic), and again, these are markedly different from the age clusters that characterize the Foziling Group. It seems, therefore, that despite the Foziling Group being at the surface in the underwater depositional area of the Hefei Basin, it was not exposed in the source area of the Hefei basinal sediments during the Jurassic, and there are two possible reasons for this. First, the exhumation of the Dabie Orogen was directed partly towards the north, in the process of which some of the Foziling Group was covered. Second, the Susong Complex rocks became involved in the development of an accretionary wedge, thus covering some of the Foziling Group during the process of subduction.},

   abstract = {Although the Cenozoic Indo-Asian collision is largely responsible for the formation of the Tibetan plateau, the role of pre-Cenozoic structures in controlling the timing and development of Cenozoic deformation remains poorly understood. In this study we address this problem by conducting an integrated investigation in the northern foreland of the Tibetan plateau, north of the Qilian Shan-Nan Shan thrust belt, NW China. The work involves field mapping, U-Pb detrital-zircon dating of Cretaceous strata in the northern foreland of the Tibetan plateau, examination of growth-strata relationships, and construction and restoration of balanced cross sections. Our field mapping reveals multiple phases of deformation in the area since the Early Cretaceous, which was expressed by northwest-trending folding and northwest-striking thrusting that occurred in the early stages of the Early Cretaceous. The compressional event was followed immediately by extension and kinematically linked right-slip faulting in the later stage of the Early Cretaceous. The area underwent gentle northwest-trending folding since the late Miocene. We estimate the magnitude of the Early Cretaceous crustal shortening to be -35%, which we interpret to have resulted from a far-field response to the collision between the Lhasa and the Qiangtang terranes in the south. We suggest that the subsequent extension in the Early Cretaceous was induced by orogenic collapse. U-Pb dating of detrital zircons, sourced from Lower Cretaceous sedimentary clasts from the north and the south, implies that the current foreland region of the Tibetan plateau was a topographic depression between two highland regions in the Early Cretaceous. Our work also shows that the Miocene strata in the foreland region of the northern Tibetan plateau was dominantly sourced from the north, which implies that the rise of the Qilian Shan did not impact the sediment dispersal in the current foreland region of the Tibetan plateau where this study was conducted.},

   abstract = {The location of the suture zone between the South China Block (SCB) and the Indochina Block (IB) is disputed. Recently, along the Song Chay (Chay river) belt, a melange zone was proposed as a potential suture zone of the SCB and IB. However, the provenance and age of the Song Chay melange is poorly known. In order to better constrain the age and provenance of the elements forming the Song Chay melange, nine samples of detrital material, and one orthogneiss were subjected to zircon U-Pb and Hf isotope analysis. Detrital zircons from the silty matrix of the Song Chay melange record three major Neoproterozoic age clusters at 580-650, 700-800, and 900-1,000 Ma, which correspond well to the substratum of the SCB. Two minor Late and Early Paleozoic age groups at 270-330, and 420-500 Ma, with mainly negative epsilon(Hf)(t) values were also recovered. We consider that the zircons in the matrix of the melange were mainly derived from the subducting plate, namely the SCB. This interpretation is supported by the occurrence of lensoid sandstone blocks, representing the substratum of the SCB, included into the melange. The deposition age of the Song Chay melange is between 310 and 250 Ma. Our results demonstrate that in an ophiolitic melange, the detrital material does not invariably come from the overriding plate, but at the onset of the collision, the subducting continental plate may also supply the terrigenous material.},

   abstract = {The Chinese Altai is one of the most typical segments of the Altai-Mongolia terrane, of which the tectonic evolution and affinity are hotly disputed and still not well constrained. Early Paleozoic metasedimentary rocks are extensive in the Altai-Mongolia terrane and their provenance is a key to unravelling the tectonic history of this terrane. Metasediments from Kulumuti Group were collected from the central Chinese Altai for geochemical study. They have low Chemical Index of Alteration (CIA = 52-54) and high Index of Compositional Variability (ICV = 0.81-1.19) values, different from the mature post-Archean Australian average shale (PAAS), indicating relatively weak chemical weathering and a source compositionally dominated by immature material that lacks alumina-rich minerals. These rocks are moderately enriched in light rare earth element (LREE) and show relatively flat heavy rare earth element (HREE) patterns (La-N/Yb-N = 2.36-9.80, Gd-N/Yb-N = 131-2.45). Compared with PAAS, they mostly have lower large ion lithophile element concentrations (e.g. Rb, Sr, Ba, Th, U and Pb) and similar contents of high field strength elements (e.g. Zr, Hf and Y), but with lower Nb and Ta. The metasediments have high Rb concentrations (>50 ppm), relatively high K2O(20 (>1.1 wt.%) and low REE contents with negative Eu/Eu* anomalies, indicating that these rocks were derived from an acid-intermediate igneous source. The rocks have slightly enriched Nd isotopic compositions with calculated initial epsilon(Nd)(t) values mostly ranging from -4.3 to -0.2 and T-DM(2) model ages between 1.22 and 1.56 Ga. Detrital zircons from two samples of the Kulumuti metasediments have similar age spectra, dominated by Early Paleozoic to latest Neoproterozoic zircons (465-576 Ma) with a few older grains formed between 766-972 Ma and 1321-2572 Ma, remarkably consistent with those from the low-grade metamorphic Habahe Group in the western Chinese Altai. In combination with previous published data, the detrital zircons from Early Paleozoic metasediments in the Chinese Altai dominantly formed between 430-580 and 750-950 Ma, with only a minor population of Meso-to Paleoproterozoic grains. When compared with adjacent terranes, the age spectrum of the Chinese Altai is most similar to that of the Tarim Craton. This craton provided Precambrian materials for the Early Paleozoic metasedimentary rocks now exposed in the Chinese Altai, and therefore suggests that the whole Altai-Mongolia terrane has a close tectonic affinity to the Tarim Craton.},

   abstract = {It remains unclear whether a crystalline basement exists in SE China (including Taiwan), whether the formation of the Tananao metamorphic belt in Taiwan was linked to subduction of the Palaeo-Pacific Plate, and whether the source rocks of the sedimentary sequences in the metamorphic belts are late Mesozoic or Palaeozoic in age. Field investigations and zircon age data in the present study indicate that there is no pre-Palaeozoic gneiss (crystalline basement) in Taiwan (although orthogneisses were produced during deformation and metamorphism of Mesozoic granites), and investigations of the metasediments show that the sedimentary sequences in the Tailuko and Yuli belts are similar. Moreover, LA-ICP-MS dating of detrital zircons from the Pingtan-Dongshan belt in Fujian Province yields a cluster of Pb-206-U-238 ages at similar to 210-190 Ma, and the Tailuko and Yuli belts in Taiwan have similar clusters of detrital zircon ages at 200 Ma, 160 Ma, 120 Ma and 110 Ma, as well as a later overprinting caused by arc-continent collision. The cathodoluminescence images and trace-element characteristics of the zircons show that they were originally magmatic in origin. This finding, combined with the Hf isotope data, indicates that the sources of sediments in the Tananao belt (Tailuko and Yuli belts) were relatively close to an active continental margin, and that both the Tailuko and Yuli belts have similar sedimentary sources. From the margin of the Chinese mainland to Taiwan, the metasediments seem to represent a continuous sequence of deposits ranging in age from Jurassic to Cretaceous, but with the sediments becoming progressively younger towards the east. It can be inferred that the sediments in the Tailuko and Yuli belts were continental-shelf sequences with sources in SE China.},

Zircons range in age from 3335 to 465 Ma. Analyses from the Cathaysia sandstone samples yield major age clusters at similar to 2560, similar to 1850, similar to 1000, and 890-760 Ma. Zircons from the eastern and central Yangtze sandstone samples show a similar age distribution with clusters at similar to 2550, similar to 1860, similar to 1100, and similar to 860-780 Ma. A minor peak at around 1450 Ma is also observed in the Cathaysia and central Yangtze age spectra, and a peak at similar to 490 Ma represents magmatic zircons from Middle Ordovician sandstone in the eastern Yangtze and Cathaysia blocks. The Cambrian and Ordovician strata show a transition from a carbonate-dominated succession in the central Yangtze Block, to an inter-stratified carbonate-siliciclastic succession in the eastern Yangtze Block, to a neritic siliciclastic succession in the Cathaysia Block. Paleocurrent data across this succession consistently indicate directions toward the W-NNW, from the Cathaysia Block to the Yangtze Block. Our data, together with other geological constraints, suggest that the Cathaysia Block constitutes a fragment on the northern margin of east Gondwana and both Cathaysia and east Gondwana constituted the source for the analyzed early Paleozoic samples. The similar age spectra for the Cambrian to Silurian sandstone samples from the Yangtze and Cathaysia blocks argue against the independent development and spatial separation of these blocks in the early Paleozoic but rather suggest that the sandstone units accumulated in an intracontinental basin that spanned both blocks. Subsequent basin inversion and Kwangsian orogenesis possibly at 400-430 Ma also occurred in an intracontinental setting probably in response to the interaction of the South China Block with the Australian-Indian margin of east Gondwana.

The majority of detrital white micas in the lower Jurassic sandstones is phengitic and originated exclusively from the Dabie high- to ultrahigh- pressure rocks. The U-Pb dating results of the detrital zircons for seven samples suggest that these synorogenic sediments have a significant change of provenance from late Triassic to early and middle Jurassic. For the upper Triassic sandstone, the U-Pb age clusters of these zircons are characterized by similar to 420-450 Ma, similar to 750-820 Ma, similar to 1050-1200 Ma and similar to 2500 Ma with minor Luliangian (similar to 1700-2000 Ma) components. In contrast, the zircon ages of the Jurassic sandstones are dominated by the Luliangian (similar to 1700-2000 Ma) ages with only minor Caledonian (similar to 420-450 Ma) and Greenville (similar to 1050-1200 Ma) ages. In combination with other available geological data, it can be concluded that the Dabie HP-UHP rocks might initially be exposed to the surface at the beginning of early Jurassic (similar to 190 Ma). The Jiangnan terrain (also named "Jiangnan old continental in Chinese) to the south of the Jianghan basin provided the predominant supply of upper Triassic sediments, whereas the Paleoproterozoic Yangtze crustal materials (overlying the present Dabie Complex at the time) were the important provenance of the Jurassic sediments in the Jianghan basin.

   abstract = {The Muang Xai Basin, located in northern Laos, is associated with the Simao, Vientiane, and Khorat Basins. The paleogeographic link of these basins has not been investigated in great detail; thus, the investigation presented in this study is a comprehensive analysis of petrology, whole-rock geochemistry, and detrital zircon U-Pb chronology used to characterize the provenance of the Muang Xai Basin. Results suggest that the sedimentary source includes felsic rocks from an active continental margin or continental arc with minor amounts of recycled passive continental margin sediments. Sandstones of the Muang Xai Basin contain detrital zircons with varying U-Pb peak ages. The youngest age peak of all the zircons is 103 Ma, which limits the age of the Mesozoic strata to the Late Cretaceous. Detrital zircon U-Pb and trace element data, combined with geochemical result, reveal that the pre-Ordovician zircons were derived from recycled sediments of the Yangtze Block, which are originally sourced from the Qinling Orogenic belt. This provenance is shared with coeval sediments in the Simao and Khorat Basins, while magmatic rocks of the Ailaoshan, Truong Son Belt, and Lincang terrane are responsible for zircons of 416-466 and 219-308 Ma in age. Zircons of 101-110 and 149-175 Ma in age were sourced from magmatic rocks of the southwestern South China Block and northern Vietnam. These provenance results suggest that sediments flow into the Khorat red beds was likely from the Great Simao Basin and northern Vietnam, and not directly from the Yangtze Block.},

   abstract = {To investigate the timing of deposition and provenance of early Mesozoic strata in the northeastern North China Craton (NCC) and to understand the early Mesozoic paleotectonic evolution of the region, we combine stratigraphy, U-Pb zircon geochronology, and Hf isotopic analyses. Early Mesozoic strata include the Early Triassic Heisonggou, Late Triassic Changbai and Xiaoyingzi, and Early Jurassic Yihe formations. Detrital zircons in the Heisonggou Formation yield similar to 58 % Neoarchean to Paleoproterozoic ages and similar to 42 % Phanerozoic ages and were sourced from areas to the south and north of the basins within the NCC, respectively. This indicates that Early Triassic deposition was controlled primarily by the southward subduction of the Paleo-Asian oceanic plate beneath the NCC and collision between the NCC and the Yangtze Craton (YC). Approximately 88 % of the sediments within the Late Triassic Xiaoyingzi Formation were sourced from the NCC to the south, with the remaining similar to 12 % from the Xing' an-Mongolia Orogenic Belt (XMOB) to the north. This implies that Late Triassic deposition was related to the final closure of the Paleo-Asian Ocean during the Middle Triassic and the rapid exhumation of the Su-Lu Orogenic Belt between the NCC and YC. In contrast, similar to 88 % of sediments within the Early Jurassic Yihe Formation were sourced from the XMOB to the north, with the remaining similar to 12 % from the NCC to the south. We therefore infer that rapid uplift of the XMOB and the onset of the subduction of the Paleo-Pacific Plate beneath Eurasia occurred in the Early Jurassic.},

With the aim to define the sedimentary provenance and tectonic evolution of the southern margin of the North China Craton, this paper presents new detrital zircon U-Pb data from Early Triassic sediments in the Yiyang area. The results showed major peaks at 1848, 458, 425, and 268 Ma and subordinate peaks at ca. 2500, 872, and 957 Ma on age spectra from the Liujiagou Formation. The Heshanggou Formation exhibited a major age peak at 445 Ma and subordinate peaks at 755 and 947 Ma. Integrated with the analysis of sandstone detrital compositions, we suggest that the sources of the Liujiagou Formation were mainly a mixture of the southern margin of the North China Craton and the North Qinling Orogenic Belt, whereas the Heshanggou Formation was derived primarily from the North Qinling Orogenic Belt. Age comparisons of detrital zircon geochronology collected from different basins in the North China Craton indicated that the paleogeography of the North China Craton during the Early Triassic was strongly asymmetric, wherein the uplifted highland along the southern margin of the North China Craton was relatively lower than the northern margin. Meanwhile, the marked shift in source region from the Liujiagou to the Heshanggou formations provides a constraint regarding the conversion from denuded zone to deposited zone along the southern margin of the North China Craton in the Early Triassic, which controlled the evolution of the provenance and sedimentary system.},

   abstract = {Basin formation and sedimentary development in the southern North China Craton (NCC) are closely related to the tectonic evolution of the Qinling Orogenic Belt (QOB). With the aim of revealing the coupling evolution between the QOB and southern NCC during the Late Palaeozoic, an investigation based on provenance analysis was performed in this study. We present new detrital zircon U-Pb data from the Middle-Late Permian sediments in the Yiyang area, southern NCC. The results show that detrital zircons, from the Middle Permian Shihezi Formation, have three major peaks at 2,447, 1,905, and 296 Ma. In contrast, the lower and upper parts of the Late Permian Sunjiagou Formation yield major peaks at similar to 1.85 Ga and similar to 260 Ma, with weak peaks at similar to 2.5 Ga, similar to 450 Ma, and similar to 315 Ma, and the middle part of the Sunjiagou Formation displays a major peak at 429 Ma. Combined with published palaeocurrent data and lithofacies palaeogeography, the sediments of the Middle Permian Shihezi Formation were sourced from the Inner Mongolia Palaeo-Uplift along the northern margin of the NCC, whereas the Upper Permian Sunjiagou Formation originated mainly from the southern margin of the NCC including the North Qinling Belt. This provenance shift indicates that the North Qinling Belt and southern margin of the NCC initiated the uplift and exhumation during the Late Permian. On the basis of the evolutionary history of the QOB, we attribute the uplift geodynamics to the Mianlue oceanic crust subduction. This study provides important sedimentological constraints for the tectonic conversion during the Late Palaeozoic along the southern margin of the NCC, which also restricts the start-up time of the Mianlue oceanic crust subduction from the perspective of the basin-mountain system.},

   abstract = {The tectonic affinity of the North China Craton (NCC) in the early Paleozoic paleogeographic reconstructions of the Gondwana supercontinent remains controversial. Here we present new detrital zircon U-Pb age data from Middle (Sandaokan Formation) to Upper Ordovician (Lashizhong Formation) sandstone deposits from biostratigraphically well-constrained strata in the Zhuozishan Mountain area, western NCC, to explore the link between NCC and Gondwana. The detrital zircon age spectra from the Sandaokan Formation range in age from 1684 to 2905 Ma with peaks of Neoarchean (similar to 2.5 Ga) and Paleoproterozoic (similar to 1.83 and similar to 1.96 Ga), and display age distribution similar to that of the Precambrian basement of the NCC. The Lashizhong Formation contains zircons ranging in age from 3626 to 488 Ma, with six main age peaks (1000-900 Ma, 2600-2400 Ma, 900-700 Ma, 700-500Ma, 1300-1100Ma and 2000-1500 Ma). The grains represent a record of the Grenville and Pan-African orogenic events, in striking contrast to those for the Sandaokan Formation. The age spectra of the Lashizhong Formation are similar to those from crustal blocks associated with eastern Gondwana. Our results suggest that the western part of the NCC might have been linked with the East Gondwana, rather than being an isolated continent block in the paleo-Pacific, as proposed in current models. The detrital zircon age populations relative to the depositional ages, sandstone lithofacies, sedimentary structures, and paleogeography suggest that the Sandaokan Formation was deposited in a passive continental margin setting, whereas the Lashizhong Formation formed in a collisional setting, which suggests an orogenic belt or suture zone located to the west of the NCC. The significant difference in provenances between the two formations within a short interval (ca. 6 Ma) might suggest a newly identified tectonic shift at ca. 458Ma, followed by the northwesternmargin transforming into a possible foreland basin stage between the NCC and the eastern Gondwana.

   abstract = {Comparisons between the tectonic units on two sides of the sinistral ENE-striking Altyn Tagh Fault (ATF) are important tracers to find out the corresponding relationships among different terranes. This study focuses on the tectonic units along the eastern segment of the ATF. The Paleoproterozoic Beidahe Group in the mid-Qilian terrane, south side of the eastern segment of the ATF, is mainly composed of metasedimentary rocks and amphibolites. These rocks are petrologically and mineralogically similar to those from the Dunhuang Group, north side of the eastern segment of the ATF. The detrital zircon U-Pb ages indicate that the protolith sediments of the Beidahe metasedimentary rocks were mainly sourced from a provenance dominated by magmatic rocks in ages of 2.85-2.55 Ga, 1.70-1.55 Ga and 1.42-1.03 Ga. This sedimentary sequence was deposited no earlier than 1.03 Ga as passive continental margin deposits. Geochemical and zircon U-Pb and Lu-Hf isotopic data suggest that the Neoarchean-Mesoproterozoic basement rocks from the Tarim Craton most likely provide the majority of source materials for their protolith. Amphibolites from the Beidahe Group have high total Fe2O3 and Al2O3 contents but low Mg# values, indicating a high degree of compositional evolution and contamination of the older crust. They have flat REE patterns but positive LILE and negative Nb-Ta and Ti anomalies, suggesting a back-arc basin basalts (BABBs) affinity for their protolith. The amphibolites have a crystallization age of 1.61 Ga and zircon epsilon(Hf)(t) values ranging from -7.7 to +10.6. The zircon epsilon(Hf)(t) values and whole-rock epsilon(Nd)(t) values indicate an involvement of juvenile and pre-existing old materials in the formation of their parental magmas. Comparisons between the Beidahe and Dunhuang Groups indicate that the metasedimentary rocks from these two groups are both sourced from the Tarim Craton but have different depositional ages, and that the amphibolites have similar crystallization ages but different tectonic settings for their source rocks. The field relationships and geochemical and geochronological characteristics of the metasedimentary rocks and amphibolites from the Beidahe Group support the interpretation that the observed recent proximity of these two rock complexes might be the result of tectonic juxtaposition rather than a primary intrusive contact.

The sandstones were classified as litharenite according to their geochemical data. The index of chemical variability and SiO2/Al2O3 ratio values suggest that the compositional maturity and recycling are weak to moderate. The weathering indices, such as chemical index of alteration, plagioclase index of alteration, and chemical index of weathering, and A-CN-K (Al2O3-(CaO*+Na2O)-K2O) ternary plot reflect that the source areas have undergone a weak degree of weathering. The TiO2 versus Zr, La/Th versus Hf, and Co/Th versus La/Sc bivariate diagrams and multimajor elements discrimination diagram of Quemoco sandstones indicate that the provenances were primarily derived from felsic igneous rocks and may also have less intermediate igneous source rocks. The paleocurrent data and low composition and textural maturity of the Quemoco sandstones suggested that the provenances are mainly from the southwest of the study area and with proximal source features. The U-Pb ages studied here could be divided into 8 groups: 206-219Ma, 268-283Ma, 446-630Ma, 700-970Ma, 1006-1346Ma, 1457-1843Ma, 2087-2214Ma, and 2331-2587Ma. The provenances are mainly from the Central Uplift Belt and surrounding of the study area according to the detrital zircon ages and rare earth element parameters, which are composed of Late Triassic tuff, Permian basalt, Early Ordovician granite, Cambrian granite gneiss, and Precambrian crystalline basement. Two multidimensional tectonic discrimination diagrams based on major elements show a complicated tectonic setting composed of a collision, rift, and minor arc setting for the Quemoco sandstones, which is consistent with the nature of a rifted margin during the late Late Triassic.},

   abstract = {Wepresent the first evidence of an early Paleozoic terrane in the southern Yanbian region, NE China. We used LAICP- MS zircon U-Pb and Hf isotope techniques to analyze one plagioclase gneiss and two garnet-bearing twomica quartz schists from the early Paleozoic Jiangyu Group, as well as two tonalites that intruded the Jiangyu Group. The tonalites yield weighted mean 206Pb/ 238U zircon crystallization ages of 423 and 422 Ma. Zircons from the Jiangyu Group gneiss and two schist samples yield maximum depositional ages of 439 +/- 4, 443 +/- 2, and 443 +/- 5 Ma, respectively. These constraints, together with the age of the tonalite intrusion, indicate that the Jiangyu Group was deposited between 443 and 423Ma (i. e., Silurian). In addition, detrital zircon age spectra of the three Jiangyu Group samples exhibit prominent age peaks at 442, 473, 513, 565, 600, 635, 671, 740, 1000, and 1162 Ma, as well as secondary peaks between 1344 and 3329 Ma. The occurrence of the prominent Meso-and Neoproterozoic detrital zircon age populations for the Jiangyu Group, combinedwith the corresponding zircon Hf isotopic data, reveals that the Jiangyu Terrane has a tectonic affinity with northeastern Gondwana. The early Paleozoicmagmatism, as suggested by themedium-K calc-alkaline I-type tonalite intrusion and Jiangyu Group detrital zircon age spectra, corresponds to coeval subduction-accretion events along the southernmargin of the eastern Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB). Accordingly, we propose that the Jiangyu Group is part of an exotic terrane that rifted from northeastern Gondwana, drifted northward, and ultimately became involved in the early Paleozoic tectonic evolution of the southern margin of the eastern CAOB after the Early Cambrian.

We present field mapping and U-Pb dating of igneous and detrital zircons that establish the lithostratigraphic architecture of the eastern Himalaya, revealing that: (1) the South Tibet detachment along the Bhutan-China border is a top-to-the-north ductile shear zone; (2) Late Triassic and Early Cretaceous sedimentary samples from the northern Indian margin show a similar age range of detrital zircons from ca. 3500 Ma to ca. 200 Ma, but the Late Triassic rocks are distinguished by a significant age cluster between ca. 280 and ca. 220 Ma and a well-defined age peak at ca. 570 Ma, (3) an augen gneiss in the South Tibet detachment shear zone in southeast Tibet has a Cambrian-Ordovician crystallization age, (4) Main Central thrust hanging-wall paragneiss and footwall quartzites from the far western Arunachal Himalaya share similar provenance and Late Proterozoic maximum depositional ages, and (5) Main Central thrust footwall metagraywacke from the central western Arunachal Himalaya has a Paleoproterozoic maximum depositional age, indicated by a single prominent age peak of ca. 1780 Ma. Recent work in the eastern Himalaya demonstrates that in the early-middle Miocene, the Himalayan crystalline core here was emplaced southward between two subhorizontal shear zones that merge to the south. A proposed subsequent (middle Miocene) brittle low-angle normal fault accomplishing exhumation of these rocks along the range crest can be precluded because new and existing mapping demonstrates only a ductile shear zone here. The ca. 280-220 Ma detrital zircons of the Late Triassic strata are derived from an arc developed along the northern margin of the Lhasa terrane. Detritus from this arc was deposited on the northern margin of India during India-Lhasa rifting. Along-strike heterogeneity in Main Central thrust footwall chronostratigraphy is indicated by detrital zircon age spectrum differences from central western to far western Arunachal. Nonetheless, the Late Proterozoic rocks in the Main Central thrust hanging wall and footwall in far western Arunachal can be correlated to each other, and to previously analyzed rocks in the South Tibet detachment hanging wall to the west and in the Indian craton to the south. These findings are synthesized in a reconstruction showing Late Triassic India-Lhasa rifting and Cenozoic eastern Himalayan construction via in situ thrusting of basement and cover sequences along the north Indian margin.},

   abstract = {Age determinations of the Triassic lithostratigraphic units of the Yanshan belt were previously based on plant fossils and regional correlations of lithologies. The Liujiagou and Heshanggou Formations were assigned as the Lower Triassic, and the Ermaying Formation was regarded as the Middle Triassic. We carried out a geochronologic study of detrital zircon grains from the Triassic sandstone in the Xiabancheng and Yingzi basins in northern Hebei where the Triassic strata are exceptionally well preserved. The results show that the Liujiagou, Heshanggou, and Ermaying Formations are all Late Triassic in age. The ages of detrital zircons also revealed that the upper part of the Shihezi Formation and the overlying Sunjiagou Formation, both of which were thought to be the Middle-Late Permian units, are actually late Early to Middle Triassic deposits. This study combines the upper Shihezi and Sunjiagou Formations into a single unit termed as the Yingzi Formation. We also substitute the widely-used Liujiagou, Heshanggou, and Ermaying Formations with the Dingjiagou, Xiabancheng, and Huzhangzi Formations, respectively. Field observations and facies analysis show that the top of the Shihezi Formation is an erosive surface, marking a parallel unconformity between the Middle Permian and Lower Triassic. The Yingzi Formation is composed mainly of meandering river deposits, indicative of tectonic quiescence and low-relief landform in the Early to Middle Triassic. In contrast, the Dingjiagou, Xiabancheng, and Huzhangzi Formations are interpreted as the deposits of sandy/gravelly braided rivers, alluvial fans, fan deltas, and deep lakes in association with volcanism, thus indicating an intense rifting setting. A new Triassic lithostratigraphic division is proposed according to age constraints and facies analysis, and the results are of significance for understanding the early Mesozoic tectonic evolution of the Yanshan belt.},

   abstract = {In order to reconstruct tectonic evolution history of the southern margin of Asia (i.e., Lhasa terrane) before the India-Asia collision, here we present a comprehensive study on the clastic rocks in the southern Lhasa terrane with new perspectives from sedimentary geochemistry, detrital zircon geochronology and Hf isotope. Clasts from the Jurassic-Early Cretaceous sedimentary sequences (i.e., Yeba and Chumulong Formations) display high compositional maturity and experienced moderate to high degree of chemical weathering, whereas those from the late Early-Late Cretaceous sequences (Ngamring and Shexing Formations) are characterized by low compositional maturity with insignificant chemical weathering. Our results lead to a coherent scenario for the evolution history of the Lhasa terrane. During the Early-Middle Jurassic (similar to 192-168Ma), the Lhasa terrane was speculated to be an isolated geological block. The Yeba Formation is best understood as being deposited in a back-arc basin induced by northward subduction of the Neo-Tethys ocean with sediments coming from the interiors of the Lhasa terrane. The Middle Jurassic-Early Cretaceous Lhasa-Qiangtang collision resulted in the formation of a composite foreland basin with southward-flowing rivers carrying clastic materials from the uplifted northern Lhasa and/or Qiangtang terranes. During the late Early-Late Cretaceous (similar to 104-72Ma), the Gangdese magmatic arc was uplifted rapidly above the sea level, forming turbidites (Ngamring Formation) in the Xigaze forearc basin and fluvial red beds (Shexing Formation) on the retro-arc side. At the end of Late Cretaceous, the Lhasa terrane was likely to have been uplifted to high elevation forming an Andean-type margin resembling the modern South America before the India-Asia collision.

   abstract = {Low-grade metamorphosed Cretaceous sedimentary records of forearc basin systems in the eastern part of the Transhimalaya (Gangdese) arc system have not been reported yet, impairing understanding of the MesozoicCenozoic convergent margin processes along the southern margin of Asia. This study incorporates observations from petrography, stratigraphy, sedimentology, and analyses of detrital-zircon geochronology and bulkrock Sr-Nd isotope for a series of low-grade metamorphosed sedimentary rocks referred to as the Lilong succession in the eastern Yarlung Zangbo suture zone, east of Langxian, in southeastern Tibet, China. Field observations reveal that this unit has three different lithological associations (I, II, and III) including gravel-coarse sandy inner-middle submarine fan facies, sandy-muddy middle-outer submarine fan facies, and silty-muddy outer submarine fan and/or deep sea plain facies moving higher in the succession. Detrital-zircon geochronology indicates a maximum depositional age of similar to 110 Ma and the absence of younger zircons that are dominant in the Gangdese batholith north of the basin suggests the minimum depositional age similar to 85 Ma, comprising an interval of the Albian-Santonian age. Volcanic and granitic clasts in sandstones/conglomerates, epsilon(Nd)(0) values (-0.09 and 4.6) and Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios (0.704105-0.704770) of slates, and detrital zircon age spectra (mainly 100-140 Ma) demonstrate provenance from the central-northern and southern Lhasa Terrane. In addition, there is evidence for recycling of cherty beds of the Chongdui Formation. Similarities between provenance, lithofacies, and tectonic setting lead us to interpret that the newly identified remnant unit correlates to the Ngamring Formation in the Xigaze forearc basin. When taking into account the lower Bomi Group and Nyingchi complex, we propose that the Lilong succession and the metamorphosed composite in the eastern Himalayan syntaxis are counterpart remnants of the eastern Xigaze forearc basin system, which are different from the two forearc basin systems in the western Himalaya.},

   abstract = {To test the idea that the voluminous upper Middle to Upper Triassic turbidite strata in the Songpan-Ganzi complex of central China archive a detrital record of Dabie ultrahigh-pressure (UHP) terrane unroofing, we report 2080 single detrital U-Pb zircon ages by sensitive high-resolution ion microprobe-reverse geometry (SHRIMP-RG) and laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) analysis from 29 eastern Songpan-Ganzi complex sandstone samples. Low (<0.07) Th/U zircons, consistent with crystallization under UHP conditions, are rare in eastern Songpan-Ganzi complex zircon, and U-Pb ages of low Th/U zircons are incompatible with a Dabie terrane source. An unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean nearest-neighbor analysis of Kolmogorov-Smirnov two-sample test results reveals that the eastern Songpan-Ganzi complex is not a single contiguous turbidite system but is instead composed of three subsidiary depocenters, each associated with distinct sediment sources. The northeastern depocenter contains zircon ages characterized by Paleozoic and bimodally distributed Precambrian zircon populations, which, together with south- to southeast-directed paleocurrent data, indicate derivation from the retro-side of the Qinling-Dabie (Q-D) collisional orogen wedge. In the central depocenter, the dominantly Paleozoic detrital zircon signature and south- to southwest-oriented paleocurrent indicators reflect a profusion of Paleozoic zircon grains. These data are interpreted to reflect an influx of material derived from erosion of Paleozoic supra-UHP rocks of the Dabie terrane in the eastern Qinling-Dabie orogen, which we speculate may have been enhanced by development of a monsoonal climate. This suggests that erosional unroofing played a significant role in the initial phase of UHP exhumation and likely influenced the petrotectonic and structural evolution of the Qinling-Dabie orogen, as evidenced by compressed Triassic isotherms/grads reported in the Huwan shear zone that bounds the Dabie terrane to the north. The central depocenter deposits reflect a later influx of bimodally distributed Precambrian zircon, signifying either a decrease in the influx of Paleozoic zircon grains due to stalled UHP exhumation and/or dilution of the same influx of Paleozoic zircons by spilling of Precambrian zircon from the northeastern depocenter into the central depocenter basin, perhaps due to infilling and bypass of sediment from the northern depocenter or due to initial collapse and constriction of the eastern Songpan-Ganzi complex basin. The southeastern depocenter of the eastern Songpan-Ganzi complex bears significant Paleozoic, Neoproterozoic, and Paleoproterozoic zircon populations derived from the South China block and Yidun arc complex, likely recording nascent uplift of the Longmenshan deformation belt due to impingement of the Yidun arc complex upon the western margin of the South China block.},

   abstract = {As one of the most ancient cratons in Asia, the North China Craton (NCC) provides an opportunity to examine the evolution of the early earth. However, it is poorly known about the tectonic setting of the Eastern Block of the NCC at 2.47-2.17 Ga. In this study, zircon U-Pb dating was conducted to constrain the provenance, depositional age, and depositional environment of the Langzishan Formation in the Liaodong peninsula, to investigate the tectonic setting of the Eastern Block during the earliest Paleoproterozoic. Provenance analysis suggests that the basal sandstones (protolith of quartzite) in the Langzishan Formation were sourced from 3.8 to 2.5 Ga continental crust, while the overlying sandstone and pelite units were sourced exclusively from 2.5 Ga continental crust. The distribution of detrital zircon ages shows that the basal sandstones of the Langzishan Formation were deposited at 2.47-2.2 Ga, during which the tectonic setting changed from an early collisional setting (2.47-2.35 Ga) to a stable continental margin (2.35-2.2 Ga), whereas pelites in the upper layer of the Langzihsan Formation were deposited at 2.2-2.17 Ga, and also experienced a transition in tectonic setting from a passive continental margin to an active continental margin. The Langzishan Formation is believed to be the lowest sedimentary unit in the Eastern Block. The transition of tectonic setting of this formation shows that the Eastern Block probably has undergone the same transition at 2.47-2.17 Ga, from a collisional setting to a passive continental margin, and then to an active continental margin, possibly related to both onset of the 2.3-2.2 Ga Paleoproterozoic tectonomagmatic lull (TML) and its cessation.},

   abstract = {The Burma Terrane (Myanmar) played an important role in the India-Asia collision and moved over 2,000 km northward on the Indian Plate during the Cenozoic, before colliding with the Asian margin. However, the timing of this collision and its correlation to regional uplift phases, sedimentary provenance, and basin development remain poorly constrained. We report sedimentological, paleomagnetic, and geochronological data from the late Eocene to early Miocene strata of the Chindwin Basin in the Burmese forearc, constraining the paleogeographic evolution of the Burma Terrane and the Eastern Himalayan orogen. Our results highlight two unconformities of late Eocene-middle Oligocene and latest Oligocene-early Miocene age, revealing a two-stage interaction of the Burma Terrane with the Asian margin during its northward translation. The first unconformity follows rapid similar to 0.6 m/ky subsidence in the Burmese forearc, as shown by magnetostratigraphy. The transition to a fluvial depositional environment and the occurrence of reworked sediments at this first unconformity likely records the commencing collision of India and the northern extent of the Burma Terrane with the Asian margin. The second unconformity shows drastic changes in magnetic properties, mineralogy, and provenance, with high-grade metamorphic grains and early Miocene apatite U-Pb and fission-track ages indicating that it is coeval to a major deformation phase in Myanmar and the Eastern Himalayan orogen. It likely records the indentation of the Burma Terrane into the Eastern Himalayan collision zone, forming the modern Eastern Himalayan Syntaxis.},

Confirming the purported connection and any subsequent drainage reorganization has garnered significant attention and varied proposed ages for reorganization. This study presents detrital zircon U-Pb ages and paleocurrents in Eocene to Pleistocene sedimentary basin deposits distributed over a broad area of the southeast Tibetan Plateau margin within the area of proposed paleoriver connectivity. When combined with previously published studies, our U-Pb ages allow examination of the temporal and spatial distributions of provenance throughout the Cenozoic. We identify six key age components of the detrital U-Pb age distributions and use these to examine the patterns of sediment provenance for different Cenozoic epochs. Detailed analysis of these components shows that provenance for both onshore and offshore deposits is best described by local bedrock sources and provides little to no evidence of regional changes in provenance. This suggests that a stable fluvial system similar to the modern drainage network has existed since the Eocene with no evidence for major provenance-altering river capture. Paleoflow measurements taken throughout the SE margin further corroborate the results of detrital zircon provenance. The combination of U-Pb age components and paleocurrent directions does not support a Cenozoic connection between the Paleo-Yangtze and Paleo-Red Rivers.},

   abstract = {North-trending rifts and associated strike-slip faults in the Tibetan Plateau suggest Ceno zoic east-west extension, but the dominant modes of distributed extensional deformation and basin formation are unclear. The Lunggar basin in west-central Tibet is bounded by a <40 degrees low-angle detachment fault, contains active high-angle normal faults, and displays elevated topography toward the central segment of the basin with axial fluvial drainage toward the northern and southern basin terminations. Structural and stratigraphic features are consistent with a high-angle extensional system that evolved into a low-angle fault and supradetachment basin during progressive extension.
This study seeks to constrain the depositional and exhumational history of the Lunggar basin and bounding fault system by assessing the sedimentologic, structural, and thermochronologic record of basin fill. Upper Cenozoic facies include alluvial-fan conglomerates and fluviolacustrine sandstones and siltstones. Sandstone petrographic data, conglomerate clast compositions, and detrital zircon U-Pb ages indicate systematic unroofing of the western footwall (including Jurassic-Cretaceous and Miocene granites that intruded Permian-Cretaceous strata). Paleocurrents are orthogonal or opposite to the current dispersal pattern, suggesting that growth of a modern intrabasin high in the central segment of the basin has modified the original basin configuration. As a proxy for footwall cooling histories, four basin-fill sandstones and 11 leucogranite boulders from proximal hanging-wall strata were sampled for low-temperature thermochronometry. Apatite and zircon (U-Th)/He results suggest that extension was underway by 10-8 Ma, with late Miocene-Pliocene exhumation rates of roughly 1 km/Myr. This rapid exhumation generated a conglomeratic unroofing sequence and promoted hanging-wall rebound and erosional recycling of range-front basin fill along the central segment of the detachment fault. The collective results support a model of rift evolution that invokes upper-crustal thinning, supra detachment basin subsidence, and subsequent isostatic rebound along the more-evolved central segments of Tibetan extensional systems.},

Examination of the northernmost margin of the Tibetan Plateau is key to unravelling the deformation mechanisms acting in northern Tibet. The left-slip Altyn Tagh fault system defines the northwest margin of the Tibetan Plateau, separating the Western and Eastern Kunlun Ranges in the southwest. Both Cenozoic and pre-Cenozoic crustal deformation events at this junction between the Altyn Tagh and Kunlun Ranges were responsible for the construction of northwestern Tibet, yet the relative contribution of each phase remains unconstrained. The western domain of the Eastern Kunlun Range is marked by active NE-trending, left-slip deformation of the Altyn Tagh fault and an E-striking Cenozoic thrust system developed in response India-Asia collision. To better constrain the Paleozoic Altyn Tagh and Kunlun orogens and establish the Cenozoic structural framework, we conducted an integrated investigation involving detailed geologic mapping (similar to 1:50,000 scale), U-Pb zircon geochronology, and synthesis of existing data sets across northwestern Tibet. Our new zircon analyses from Paleoproterozoic-Cretaceous strata constrain stratigraphic age and sediment provenance and highlight Proterozoic-Paleozoic arc activity. We propose a tectonic model for the Neoproterozoic-Mesozoic evolution of northwestern Tibet wherein restoration of an similar to 56-km-long balanced cross section across the western domain of the Eastern Kunlun suggests that Cenozoic minimum shortening strain was similar to 30% (similar to 24 km shortening). Field evidence suggests this shortening commenced after ca. 25-20 Ma, which yields an average long-term shortening rate of 1.2-0.9 mm yr(-1) and strain rates of 4.7 x 10(-16) s(-1) to 2.3 x 10(-16) s(-1). Geometric considerations demonstrate that this contractional deformation did not significantly contribute to left-slip offset on the Altyn Tagh fault, which has similar to 10 mm/yr slip rates.},

This effort reveals five stages of arc magmatism at 1005-910 Ma, 790-720 Ma, 580-500 Ma, 490-375 Ma, and 290-195 Ma, respectively. Arc activities were interrupted by repeated continent-continent collision followed by ocean opening along the older suture zones first created in the Neoproterozoic. This suggests that Wilson cycles have played a controlling role in constructing the southern Asian continent. The magmatic history and regional geologic constraints allow us to construct a coherent tectonic model that has the following key features.

   abstract = {The Eastern Kunlun Range in north Tibet, located along the northern margin of the eastern Tethyan orogenic system, records evidence for continental break-up and ocean development in the Neoproterozoic, Paleozoic-early Mesozoic subduction and continental collision, Mesozoic intracontinental extension, and Cenozoic contractional deformation. The Kunlun region is marked by active left-lateral strike-slip deformation of Kunlun fault system, one of the major intracontinental strike-slip faults in Tibet that developed in response India-Asia. To better constrain the tectonic evolution of the Eastern Kunlun Range and the closure of the various Kunlun oceans, we conducted detailed investigation integrating new geologic mapping, geochronology, and whole-rock geochemistry with a synthesis of existing datasets across north Tibet. The Eastern Kunlun Range experienced three major deformation events in the Neoproterozoic, early Paleozoic, and Late Paleozoic-early Mesozoic, which were associated with collision of the Proto-, Paleo-, and Neo-Kunlun arcs, respectively. Our new detrital zircon analyses from Mesoproterozoic-Cenozoic strata constrain stratigraphic age and sediment provenance and highlight the importance of three periods of arc activity. Our stratigraphic synthesis, including new field observations, provides new insights into connections between sediment dispersal and changes in tectonism and paleogeography. Miocene-to-present strike-slip activity on the Kunlun fault and the associated strain pattern can be explained by clockwise rotation of the Kunlun fault and its wall rock as a bookshelf-fault system, which has been proposed for northern Tibet as a result of distributed north-south right-lateral shear. The development of this fault system was facilitated by the presence of a Triassic suture that provided a preexisting weakness. Plain Language Summary The Eastern Kunlun Range in northern Tibet is located within the interior high-elevation Tibetan Plateau. Its current morphology and geologic structure reflect Cenozoic faulting related to India-Asia convergence since the early Cenozoic. Active deformation across the Eastern Kunlun Range reactivates complex older geologic relationships that record prior oceanic subduction and continental collision events. We present field and analytical observations from key sites along the Kunlun and Xiangride Rivers across the Eastern Kunlun Range to establish the pre-Cenozoic geologic history of this region. Our dating of arc-related intrusions and sedimentary rocks reveals that three distinct ocean-closure-related collisions occurred here over the last billion years. This repeated focused deformation has been reactived most recently in the Cenozoic to for the left-slip Kunlun fault.},

   abstract = {The present-day Tibetan plateau, which is the largest highland on Earth, formed primarily due to the India-Asia collision since 50-60 Ma. The development of the plateau has been associated with the Cenozoic development of two large intra-plateau sedimentary basins in north-central Tibet: the Qaidam and Hoh Xil basins to the north and south of the Eastern Kunlun Range, respectively. We conducted an integrated study of these two basins and the Eastern Kunlun Range that separates them to understand the timing and mechanisms of their development in order to decipher the growth and uplift history of the plateau. Crustal shortening in the Fenghuoshan-Nangqian and Qilian Shan-Nan Shan thrust belts initiated no later than the early Eocene, which formed the northern and southern boundaries of the combined Hoh Xil and Qaidam basins in central Tibet. The distinct two-stage development of the Hoh Xil basin suggests emergence of a topographic barrier between the Hoh Xil basin in the south and Qaidam basin in the north in the early Neogene, which is supported by the existing and new apatite fission-track data from the Eastern Kunlun Range that suggest rapid cooling after ca. 20 Ma. Previous and newly collected geochronological, petrological, and thermochronological data are best interpreted in the context of the Paleogene Paleo-Qaidam hypothesis, which requires Hoh Xil and Qaidam basins to have been parts of a single integrated basin during the early stage of the Cenozoic Tibetan plateau development.},

   abstract = {[1] India-Asia collision has resulted in the largest orogenic event on Earth since at least 500 Ma, and this has had a profound influence on the drainage patterns of Asia, on the Asian monsoon climate, on global oceanography, as well as on faunal extinctions. Despite this importance, understanding of the Paleogene evolution of this system is limited. U-Pb and Lu-Hf isotopic analyses of detrital zircons from the clastic sedimentary rocks of the Indus Molasse, located within the Indus Suture of the Ladakh Himalaya, India, show that most have Mesozoic-Cenozoic ages and juvenile Hf isotopic compositions. This suggests that the main source of these sediments is the Transhimalayan batholith, with minor flux from the Lhasa-Karakoram terrane and Indian plate. The lower Indus Molasse ( Chogdo Formation) is inferred to have been deposited at 60 - 49 Ma, whereas the upper Choksti Formation was deposited later than 45-41 Ma and contains a greater contribution from the Lhasa terrane. The Transhimalayan batholith was eroded throughout Indus Molasse sedimentation, but increasing exhumation of Lhasa-Karakoram terrane indicates its progressive uplift after initial collision, and requires formation of apaleo-Indus River shortly after collision.},

   abstract = {Before the continental collision of India with Asia, northward subduction of the Tethyan oceanic lithosphere beneath South Asia resulted in widespread arc magmatism in the Lhasa terrane of southern Tibet from Early Jurassic to Eocene time. The detailed magmatic history of this Transhimalayan arc system, however, remains unclear. Here we report in-situ detrital zircon U-Pb and Hf isotopic analyses of sedimentary rocks from the Xigaze fore-arc basin, which developed along the southern margin of the Lhasa terrane. The zircon U-Pb results allow us to better constrain the depositional age of the Xigaze Group, which consists from bottom to top of the Chongdui, Ngamring, Padana and Qubeiya formations deposited between ca. 116 and 65 Ma, with the main stage (i.e., the Ngamring Formation) being deposited between ca. 107 and 84 Ma. The majority of these zircons are characterized by high Hf-176/Hf-177 isotopic ratios and positive epsilon(Hf)(t) values that are similar to those of magmatic zircons from the Gangdese batholith, suggesting the latter was a predominant source provenance of the fore-arc sediments. In the younger sequences, i.e., the upper Ngamring and Padana/Qubeiya formations, zircons that record either pre-Mesozoic U-Pb ages or negative CHKO values become more abundant, implying additional sources from the northern Lhasa and/or Qiangtang terranes due to northward development of the fluvial systems. The overall zircon U-Pb and Hf isotopic data furthermore suggest that during fore-arc deposition, the exposed Gangdese arc was dominated by igneous rocks formed between 130 and 80 Ma, associated with lesser amounts zircon with ages between 190 and 150 Ma, thus recording two important stages of arc magmatism that are only sporadically preserved in modern outcrops as a result of extensive erosion related to uplift during Mesozoic-Cenozoic time.

   abstract = {The crustal evolution of North Korea is poorly constrained. This study utilises detrital zircon U-Pb and Lu-Hf isotopic data, obtained from sands at the mouths of the Taedong, Chongchon and Songchon Rivers, in order to sample the Rangnim massif. These data are then used to constrain the magmatic age spectrum and crustal growth history of this massif. Zircon U-Pb analyses indicate that the Rangnim Massif, previously considered to be an Archean block, is characterized by similar to 1.8 Ga magmatism, with subsequent peaks at 220 and 110 Ma. Archean magmatism appears to be limited, which is in marked contrast to the nearby North China Craton in terms of the timing of Precambrian events although the oldest age obtained is similar to 3.4 Ga, indicating the existence of some Mesoarchean material in North Korea. In situ zircon Hf isotopic data show that some zircons have Hf model ages up to 4.0 Ga, suggesting a more ancient crustal history. The Hf isotopic data also indicate that the similar to 1.8 Ga zircons have Archean Hf model ages, suggesting derivation from recycled Archean material. Phanerozoic zircons are less abundant than those of Precambrian age, however, the limited data indicate that Phanerozoic magmatism mostly occurred in the Mesozoic, accompanied by significant juvenile crustal growth. The similarities of the crustal formation ages and similar to 1.8 Ga thermal event between the Rangnim Massif and the North China Craton indicate that they were probably a coherent block since Archean time.

   abstract = {The basement of the Argun massif in the northern Great Hinggan Range consists of the metamorphic supracrustal rocks of the Xinghuadukou Group and associated granitic complexes. The metamorphic supracrustal rocks were previously interpreted as Paleoproterozoic, while the granitic complexes were considered Mesoproterozoic in age. This paper presents new zircon LA-MC-ICP-MS U-Pb ages of biotite-plagioclase leptynite and biotite schist from the Xinghuadukou Group in the Lulin Forest area, Heilongjiang Province; zircon SHRIMP U-Pb ages of biotite-plagioclase gneiss from the Xinghuadukou Group in Lulin Forest; and quartz diorite and monzogranite from the granitic complexes in Mohe County, Heilongjiang Province. New geochronological data from the three metasedimentary rock samples of the Xinghuadukou Group can be preliminarily divided into five groups: (1) 2017-2765 Ma, (2) 1736-1942 Ma, (3) 1359-1610 Ma. (4) 749-1239 Ma. and (5) 448-716 Ma. Except for the zircons of the 448-716 Ma group belonging to a metamorphic origin, the other age groups had the youngest age of 749 +/- 17 Ma, indicating that the Xinghuadukou Group formed during the Neoproterozoic era (at least <749 Ma). These detrital zircon ages cluster at ca. 2.0-1.8 Ga and ca. 1.0-0.80 Ga, suggesting that the Argun massif had connections with both Columbia and Rodinia and implying that the provenance of the Xinghuadukou Group metamorphosed sediments must be characteristic of felsic-intermediate igneous rocks with ages of ca. 2.0-1.8 Ga and ca. 1.0-0.80 Ga. The quartz diorite and monzogranite from the granitic complexes of the basement within the Argun massif yielded weighted mean ages of 516 +/- 10 Ma and 504 +/- 9 Ma, respectively, indicating that these rocks emplaced in the Early Paleozoic. Considering the geochemical and chronological data together, we propose that the Xinghuadukou Group was most likely deposited in a back-arc basin environment, whereas the granitic complexes emplaced in a post-collisional setting. A wide age spectrum of detrital zircons ranging from 749 +/- 9 to 2765 +/- 11 Ma with ages clustering approximately 2.0-1.8 Ga and 1.0-0.80 Ga suggests that the basement rocks of the Argun massif are chiefly composed of the Neoproterozoic metasedimentary sequence and Early Paleozoic granitic complexes, with a few Meso- to Paleoproterozoic and even Neoarchean metamorphic rocks.

   abstract = {Due to sparse data for deciphering the late Neoproterozoic tectonic history, there is still considerable debate on whether long-lasting superplume-related or long-duration subduction-related dynamics dominated the Tarim Craton. In this contribution, our field investigations detail the late Neoproterozoic siliciclastic successions, and we report the first granitic conglomerates with zircon U-Pb ages of 753.9 +/- 3.7 Ma in the SW Tarim Craton. Importantly, detrital zircons from the thick Cryogenian sedimentary basin also contain a major zircon population at ca. 750 Ma. Together with seismic data, this suggests a large ca. 750 Ma magmatic event in the SW Tarim Craton. Geochemically, the granitic clasts exhibit A-type granite features with high SiO2, high alkali but extremely low K, high FeOT/MgO and Ga/Al, and high high-field strength elements (HFSEs) (i.e. Nb, Hf, and Ta) with significant depletion in Rb, K, Sr, P, Eu, and Ti, and significant negative Eu anomalies (Eu* = 0.13-0.36), showing ferroan granite affinities. Including the detrital zircons, the ca. 750 Ma zircons have a large range of negative epsilon Hf(t) values (-19.46 to -1.16). Elemental and zircon Hf isotope data suggest that the granites were derived from Palaeoproterozoic reworked continental crust and are probably related to crustal thinning and extension. By comparison with previous studies, we conclude that Rodinia breakup was diachronous in the outer parts of the supercontinent.},

   abstract = {Widespread Paleozoic and Mesozoic granites are characteristics of SE China, but the geodynamic mechanisms responsible for their emplacement are an issue of ongoing debate. To shed new light on this issue, we present an integrated geochronological and isotopic study of detrital zircon and monazite from Cambrian metasandstones and modern beach sands in the Yangjiang region, SE China. For the Cambrian metasandstone sample, detrital zircon displays a wide age range between 490 and 3000 Ma, while monazite grains record a single age peak of 235 Ma. The results suggest that a significant Triassic (235 Ma) metamorphic event is recorded by monazite but not zircon. For the beach sand sample, detrital zircon ages show six peaks at ca. 440, 240, 155, 135, 115, and 100 Ma, whereas detrital monazite yields a dominant age peak at 237Ma and a very minor age peak at 435 Ma. Beach sand zircon displays features that are typical of a magmatic origin. Their Hf-O isotopes reveal two crustal reworking events during the early Paleozoic and Triassic, in addition to one juvenile crustal growth event during the Jurassic-Cretaceous. The beach sand monazite records intense Triassic igneous and metamorphic events with significant crustal reworking. Such early Paleozoic and Triassic geochemical signatures of detrital zircon and monazite suggest they were derived from granitoids and metamorphic rocks which formed in intraplate orogenies, i.e., the early Paleozoic Wuyi-Yunkai Orogeny and Triassic Indosinian Orogeny. The Jurassic-Cretaceous signature of detrital zircon may reflect multistage magmatism that was related to subduction of the Paleo-Pacific Plate beneath SE China.},

   abstract = {The Northern Liaoning Complex in northeastern China constitutes an important component of the Eastern Block in the North China Craton. The major lithologies consist of Archean granitoid gneisses with minor supracrustal rocks occurring as tectonic lenses. This study presents zircon Lu-Hf isotopic data for the first time as well as new SHRIMP zircon U-Pb data of the major lithologies from the Northern Liaoning Complex, in order to elucidate the crustal evolution of the complex and provide new constraints on the Neoarchean crustal evolution of the Eastern Block in the North China Craton. Magmatic zircon U-Pb data from this study show that the protolith magmas of the supracrustal rocks and granitoid gneisses were generated during similar to 2.55-2.50 Ga. Metamorphic zircons document consistent metamorphic ages at 2.49-2.48 Ga, suggesting a regional metamorphic event immediately after the magmatism at the end of the Neoarchean in the Northern Liaoning Complex. Inherited/detrital zircons of 2.79-2.60 Ga suggest possible existence of ancient crust in this region. Zircon Lu-Hf isotopic compositions show that the magmatic zircons have variable epsilon(Hf)(t) values from -4.0 to +9.0 with depleted mantle model ages of 3.6-2.5 Ga, of which most epsilon(Hf)(t) values are positive with a model age peak at 2.9-2.7 Ga. These zircon Hf signatures reveal major juvenile crustal growth with additions of older crustal materials during 2.9-2.7 Ga, and a crustal reworking event with minor juvenile additions at 2.6-2.5 Ga in the studied area. Integrated with previous data from other Neoarchean complexes in the Eastern Block, both the major juvenile crustal growth during 2.9-2.7 Ga and the strong crustal reworking at 2.6-2.5 Ga contribute to the extensive Neoarchean crust formation of the Eastern Block in the North China Craton. The North China Craton share similar Neoarchean continental crustal evolution to other cratons in the world, though it is distinctively featured by intensive tectonothermal overprinting at the end of the Neoarchean.

Detrital zircons ages from the sedimentary xenoliths have four prominent peaks at 2.5-2.4 Ga, 1.9-1.8 Ga, 480-400 Ma, and 350-300 Ma, whereas those from the country rock exhibit another four prominent peaks at 1.9-1.8 Ga, 850-700 Ma, 480-400 Ma, and 300-250 Ma. Based on comparison with age data from previous studies, we suggest that the sedimentary xenoliths are from the Lanashan Formation and the major provenance of them is Qiangtang Block, Zhongza massif and South China Block, whereas the country rock belongs to the Lamaya Formation and the major provenance of them is similar to those of the neighbouring Songpan-Garze terrane. In addition, the inherited zircons from the Late Triassic granites in the eastern Yidun arc belts have a prominent Neoproterozoic age population (900-700 Ma), which suggests that there is an old basement with west Yangtze Craton affinity beneath the Triassic sediments. Combining with previous studies, we propose that the provenances of the formations vary from the Lanashan Formation to the Lamaya Formation which may indicate a record of the final closure of the Garze-Litang Ocean.},

   abstract = {We undertook an integrated approach incorporating whole-rock geochemistry and detrital zircon U-Pb geochronology from Permian sedimentary rocks in the Solonker area of central Inner Mongolia, China with the aim of constraining the tectonic evolution of the eastern segment of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt. Geochemical analysis reveals a close relationship between the sedimentary and volcanic rock suites in the study region. Detrital zircons from seven samples collected from the Zhesi Formation yield U-Pb ages that cluster around 309-275 Ma and 464-435 Ma, with two main age peaks of 452 and 288 Ma. However, additional detrital zircons with ages in the range of 2,634-543 Ma are sparse and with no obvious age peaks. The results suggest that the deposition of the Zhesi Formation occurred from the Middle to the Late Permian and from two major age provenances: the Precambrian basement of the North China Plate (1,880 Ma and 2,520 Ma) and the Paleozoic Southern orogenic belt along the northern margin of North China (288 Ma and 452 Ma). In this contribution, we suggest that the Zhesi Formation in the Solonker area formed in response to the Early to Middle Permian subduction tectonic setting of the Paleo-Asian Ocean (PAO), probably formed in a forearc basin and that the final closure of the PAO occurred after the Late Permian.},

   abstract = {The first occurrence of blueschist in the Neoproterozoic signifies a transition in thermal regime from a warmer Archean-Proterozoic Earth to modem colder subduction characterized by blueschist facies or ultrahigh pressure metamorphism. To evaluate the thermal regime of the transition, we apply phase equilibrium modeling to the Aksu blueschist in northwestern China to constrain the pressure (P) and temperature (T) conditions of the peak mineral assemblages and to calculate the thermal regime recorded by the blueschist. Phase equilibrium modeling in the Na2O-CaO-K2O-FeO-MgO-Al2O3-SiO2-H2O-O system indicates that the peak mineral assemblage (glaucophane/riebeckite + epidote + phengite + albite + quartz + chlorite) was developed at P-T conditions of 6.8-8.7 kbar and 320-410 degrees C for a stilpnomelane-bearing epidote blueschist (AK04) and of 6.5-8.0 kbar and 310-380 degrees C for an epidote blueschist (AK06). These P-T data define an apparent thermal gradient of similar to 470 degrees C/GPa for the peak stage which is typical of the high-pressure intermediate type metamorphic facies series. In addition, we present new LA-ICP-MS U-Pb ages from detrital zircons from two blueschists (AK04 and AK06) and SHRIMP U-Pb ages from zircon from a cross-cutting post-metamorphic mafic dyke (AK134) to constrain the age of the metamorphism. The youngest concordant detrital zircon ages give a maximum depositional age for the blueschist protoliths of 806 +/- 10 (AK04) and 803 +/- 10 Ma (AK06), respectively, and the SHRIMP U-Pb ages of zircons from the mafic dyke yields a weighted mean age of 769 19 Ma interpreted to date crystallization. These results constrain the age of Aksu blueschist facies metamorphism to between 769 +/- 19 and c. 805 Ma.},

   abstract = {The Tianshan Orogenic Belt, which is located in the southwestern part of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB), is an important component in the reconstruction of the tectonic evolution of the CAOB. In order to examine the evolution of the Tianshan Orogenic Belt, we performed detrital zircon U-Pb dating analyses of sediments from the accretionary melange from Chinese southwestern Tianshan in this study. A total of 542 analyzed spots on 541 zircon grains from five samples yield Paleoarchean to Devonian ages. The major age groups are 2520-2400 Ma, 1890-1600 Ma, 1168-651 Ma, and 490-390 Ma. Provenance analysis indicates that, the Precambrian detrital zircons were probably mainly derived from the paleo-Kazakhstan continent formed before the Early Silurian by amalgamation of the Kazakhstan-Yili microplate, the Chinese central Tianshan terrane and the Kyrgyz North and Middle Tianshan blocks, while detrital zircons with Paleozoic ages mainly from igneous rocks of the continental arc generated by the northward subduction of the south Tianshan paleocean. The age data correspond to four tectono-thermal events that took place in these small blocks, i.e., the continental nucleus growth during the Late Neoarchean-early Paleoproterozoic (similar to 2.5 Ga), the evolution of the supercontinents Columbia (2.1-1.6 Ga) and Rodinia (1.3-0.57 Ga), and the arc magmatism related with the Phanerozoic orogeny. The Precambrian zircons show a similar age pattern as the Tarim and the Cathaysia cratons and the Eastern India-Eastern Antarctica block but differ from those of Siberia distinctly. Therefore, the Tianshan region blocks and the Kazakhstan-Yili microplate have a close affinity to the eastern paleo-Gondwana fragments, but were not derived from the Siberia craton as proposed by some previous researchers. These blocks were likely generated by rifting accompanying Rodinia break-up in late Precambrian times. The youngest ages of the detrital zircons from the subduction melange show a maximum depositional age of ca. 390 Ma. It is coeval with the end of an earlier arc magmatic pulse (440-390 Ma) but a bit older than a younger one at 360-320 Ma and nearly 70-80 Ma older than the HP-UHP metamorphism in the subduction zone (320-310 Ma).

Along the SW basin margin, a continuous record is preserved in the 3000-m-thick Cenozoic succession at the Changweitai area. An up-section switch from marginal and deep lacustrine sedimentation to lacustrine delta-alluvial fan deposition indicates progradation and increasingly basinward advance of sediment transportation systems. Provenance data from sandstone petrology, palaeocurrent analysis and zircon U-Pb geochronology suggest that the Eastern Kunlun Range has been consistently providing material to the SW Qaidam basin since the deposition of the upper Xiaganchaigou Formation, indicating its latest uplift episode prior to the Late Eocene (before 35.5 Ma). However, variation in depositional systems indicates a clear shift in sediment provenance between the deposition of the Xiayoushashan Formation and the Shangyoushashan Formation. We propose that the Cenozoic Eastern Kunlun Range experienced a northward encroachment of shortening into the Qaidam Basin. During the Early Miocene, extensive topographic growth of the Altyn Tagh Range caused by reactivation of the Altyn Tagh strike-slip fault, provided the main source of sediment for the western Qaidam basin. Subsequently, a new source for the basin was provided by the uplifting Qimen Tagh subrange since 15 Ma. [GRAPHICS] .},

   abstract = {The provenance and tectonic setting of the Lower-Middle Triassic clastic sediments from the Napo basin, South China, have been examined here using detrital modes, whole-rock geochemistry and detrital zircon U-Pb ages. Field investigations indicate that these sediments consist of fan delta, slope and turbidity fan facies with dominantly southward palaeocurrent directions. Detrital modes and geochemical characteristics of the clastic rocks indicate that they were derived from mixed magmatic arc and Palaeozoic successions in a continental island arc setting, with no significant sediment recycling. The U-Pb age spectra of sandstone detrital zircons from different stratigraphic positions are similar, with one major group (300-230 Ma), two subordinate groups (400-320 Ma and 480-420 Ma, respectively) and two scattered groups (1200-800 Ma and 2000-1700 Ma, respectively). Thus, we consider that the north late Permian - Middle Triassic volcanic rocks and the uplifted Palaeozoic sedimentary/volcanic sequences constituted the predominant sources. The detritus derived from the late Permian Emeishan mafic rocks is subordinate and limited. The pre-Devonian zircons are likely sedimentary-recycled or magmatic-captured instead of directly derived from the early Palaeozoic orogen (e.g. Yunkai massif) and Neoproterozoic Jiangnan orogen because of the topographic barrier of a magmatic arc and carbonate platform. Considering the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of the volcanic arc and ophiolite, we suggest that the Triassic Napo basin was a fore-arc basin within a continental island arc setting, which developed in response to the northward subduction of the Babu-Cao Bang branch ocean beneath the South China Block.},

Most of the more than 200 detrital zircons analyzed in this study have positive initial epsilon(Hf) values and a wide range of Hf depleted mantle model ages (T-DM(C)) that range from 2.08 Ga to 2.74 Ga, with a peak at 2.24 to 2.40 Ga. The whole rock Nd isotopic analyses for the khondalite samples give quite uniform Nd-143/Nd-144 ratios from 0.511188 to 0.511858, corresponding to initial epsilon(Nd) ((2.10Ga)) values ranging from -1.6 to +0.6. In contrast, Sr isotopic compositions of these samples are more varied, with initial Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios at 2.10 Ga ranging from 0.7017 to 0.7076. In the epsilon(Nd) versus Sr-87/Sr-86 correlation diagram, most samples plot near the mixing hyperbola of the depeleted mantle and crust, with the contribution of depleted mantle about 65 to 75 percent. These results suggest that a large amount of juvenile materials from the depleted mantle was accreted to the Western Block at 2.1 Ga, a period of magmatic quiescence in many cratons of the world.},

   abstract = {It is generally accepted that the Tianshan was reactivated repeatedly throughout Meso-Cenozoic time. However, the extent of these episodes has not been fully understood. Using a previous magnetostratigraphic baseline, this study reports a detrital zircon U-Pb and apatite fission track dating study along the similar to 4 km thick Cenozoic Jingou River section at the southern margin of the Junggar Basin. Our results provide direct insight into the denudation history of the bordering Tianshan Mountains and suggest that they experienced two phases of rapid cooling in the Jurassic and Cretaceous. These cooling phases are attributed to tectonic events at distant plate margins such as the Late Triassic-Cretaceous accretion of peri-Gondwartan blocks (e.g. Qiangtang and Lhasa). The detrital zircon U-Pb ages range widely from similar to 58 to 3055 Ma with a majority falling between similar to 58 and 600 Ma. They can be statistically separated into two primary age peaks at 300-290 Ma and 450-410 Ma, as well as two secondary peaks at 170 Ma and 850 Ma. Detrital zircon U-Pb dating results suggest that the Central Tianshan may have still shed detritus into the Junggar Basin during the Early Palaeogene. In the Late Oligocene-Early Miocene, the modern North Tianshan started to form a topographic barrier that blocked all northward rivers flowing from the Central Tianshan to the Junggar Basin. Progressive northward indentation of India into Eurasia, caused a final intense phase of cooling and denudation of the Tianshan between similar to 11 and 3 Ma, leading to deposition of the Xiyu Formation, a widely distributed thick conglomerate.},

   abstract = {Neoproterozoic volcanic and sedimentary rocks, cropping out along the Chengkou-Fengxi Fault on the northern margin of the Yangtze Block in China, consist primarily of volcaniclastic deposits and sandstone-conglomerate successions. The volcaniclastic deposits (termed the Longtanhe Formation) are composed of volcanogenic sedimentary rocks with several primary volcaniclastic rock interlayers. The Longtanhe Formation provides a good opportunity to investigate the Neoproterozoic tectonic evolution of the northern margin of the Yangtze Block. In this paper, geochemistry and zircon U-Pb geochronology are used to infer the provenance and tectonic setting of the Longtanhe Formation volcaniclastic rocks. Two volcanic sandstone samples, collected from the base and top part of the Longtanhe Formation respectively, and one tuff sample were studied for zircon U-Pb dating. They show three consistent age populations with peaks at similar to 825 Ma, similar to 770 Ma and 703 Ma, indicating that the Longtanhe Formation was deposited after 703 Ma and there were no changes in the sources during the period of sedimentation. Chondrite-normalized REE patterns are uniform with slight LREE enrichment (La-N/Yb-N, average 3.8) and flat HREE patterns without a distinct Eu anomaly (Eu/Eu*, average 0.99), indicating a magmatic arc source. Sc-V enrichment, high La/Th (average 9.4), Cr/Ni (average 2.1) and low Th/Sc (commonly <0.1) suggest that the volcaniclastic rocks were mainly derived from basic to intermediate rocks. Large volumes of basaltic to andesitic clasts in volcaniclastic rocks also suggests that the source rocks were predominantly mafic rocks. A few samples have higher Th/Sc (0.12-0.24) ratios and Hf (4.70-4.90) contents implying minor felsic rocks in the source area. A small amount of quartz clasts in matrix for these six samples also supports a minor contribution from felsic rocks. Not only the lapilli in tuff but also the pebbles and lithic grains in volcanic sandstones are characterized by poor rounding, indicating that the Longtanhe Formation was deposited near-source. Both major- and trace-element discrimination diagrams suggest an oceanic island arc-related setting for the Longtanhe Formation. All these lines of evidence suggest that a contemporaneous (703 Ma) magmatic arc, primarily consisting of basalt to andesite, was the main source for the Longtanhe Formation volcaniclastic rocks. The older and minor felsic components were probably derived from mafic to felsic rocks with an arc signature that cropped out widely in the Hannan Complex (840-746 Ma) and/or Yaolinghe Group (845 730 Ma). Based on its arc-related geochemical affinity, the Longtanhe Formation is proposed to have been deposited in an oceanic arc-related setting, indicating that oceanic crust subduction beneath the northern margin of the Yangtze Block had not ended before 703 Ma.

   abstract = {The West Qinling Orogenic Belt (WQOB) in central China witnessed the closure of the Paleo-Tethys Ocean and the subsequent amalgamation between the North China Block and the South China Block during the Permian-Jurassic. However, the pre-closure Triassic tectonic evolution of the WQOB remains poorly constrained. Thick Triassic sedimentary successions are well preserved in the Xiahe-Hezuo district and provide significant infor-mation for investigating the tectonic setting in the WQOB. Here we present U-Pb ages and Hf isotopic compo-sitions of detrital zircons from a pebbly slate of clastic sedimentary rock that comprises the Longwuhe Formation of the WQOB, the Xiahe-Hezuo district, Central China. The detrital zircon U-Pb ages vary from 2525 Ma to 244 Ma and are distributed in five periods, i.e., 2525-2225 Ma, 2013-1676 Ma, 1127-883 Ma, 501-438 Ma, and 330-244 Ma. The youngest detrital zircon age peak of ca. 250 Ma constrains the maximum depositional age of the Longwuhe Formation to the Early Triassic. Provenance analysis indicates that the WQOB, the eastern Qilian Orogenic Belt, and the southern North China Block serve as the main source of the pebble-bearing slate. The detrital zircon of 330-281 Ma in the WQOB implies likely the presence of an Early Triassic continental arc. Integrated results of the regional structure, geochronology, and geochemistry of the Triassic granites in the WQOB suggest that the Longwuhe Formation was probably deposited in a forearc setting at ca. 250 Ma and followed immediately by arc magma intrusion in Early Triassic. Thus, the WQOB was possibly generated as a continental arc associated with the northward subduction of the Qinling Paleo-Tethys Ocean lithosphere during the Early Triassic.},

   abstract = {The Yellow River (YR) is one of the longest and most sediment-laden rivers in the world. However, the timing and mechanism of the integration of upstream and downstream reaches of the YR is still debated, with estimates ranging from >34 Ma to similar to 0.15 Ma. Here we address this debate by studying the detrital-zircon age spectra from three boreholes that penetrate late Miocene sediment in the lower YR floodplain. Our results show a significant provenance change between 1.6 and 1.5 Ma marking the input of new materials from the Middle Reach and/or the Upper Reach, suggesting the upstream and downstream parts of the YR were connected between 1.6 and 1.5 Ma. This late establishment of the YR is not consistent with the timing of uplift of the northeastern Tibetan Plateau and surrounding mountain ranges and thus precludes a tectonic control; however, it follows the Plio-Pleistocene onset of large-amplitude sea level changes, associated with a worldwide increase of fluvial incision. We propose that Plio-Pleistocene base level fluctuations likely triggered fluvial erosion propagating upstream from the YR lower reach and were thus the main driving force for river integration.},

   abstract = {The tectonic setting of the Tangjia-Sumdo metamorphic belt, which separates the North Lhasa Block (NLB) and South Lhasa Block (SLB), remains controversial. Moreover, the sedimentary evolution of the Tangjia-Sumdo metamorphic belt has been little studied, particularly during the early subduction evolution of the Sumdo PaleoTethys Ocean (SPTO). Here we present petrological, geochemical, and zircon U-Pb geochronological data on the clastic rocks and metabasaltic interlayers collected from the Sumdo Formation in the Sumdo area. The Sumdo Formation consists of metamorphosed sandstone, graywacke, phyllite, and interlayered metabasalts. Detrital zircon U-Pb dating of the metasandstone and quartz schist identified a youngest zircon age group of 389-316 Ma, which have negative epsilon Hf(t) values (-20.5 to -1.5) and old Hf crustal model ages (TCDM = 1450-2654 Ma). The zircon trace element features and Hf isotopic compositions show that the sedimentary detritus was sourced from the NLB, which indicates that this terrane experienced Late Devonian-early Carboniferous magmatism. The ages of the youngest detrital zircons (YC2 sigma age of 324 +/- 13 Ma) indicate that the Sumdo Formation formed mainly during the late Carboniferous-early Permian. Combined with geochemical data of the metabasalts and other regional geological evidence, we conclude that the Sumdo Formation formed in an initial forearc basin. The Sumdo Formation was likely deposited along an active continental margin according to the in-situ suture model, where northward subduction of the Sumdo Paleo-Tethys oceanic lithosphere occurred beneath the NLB. As such, the Sumdo Formation provides a sedimentary record of the early subduction evolution of the SPTO.},

The Yingshuiquan Formation is composed of oolitic limestone, calcareous sandstone, calcarenite, thin-bedded ribbon limestone, bioclastic limestone, and coarse oolite limestone that were deposited in a shallow-marine basin and contain abundant Lower Triassic conodont fossils (e.g. Hadrodontina anceps, Pachycladina sp., gen. et sp, Pachyclaina oblique, Hibbardelloides sp). We selected detrital zircons from four calcareous sandstone samples for U-Pb dating, yielding minimum age peaks of 263, 269, 275, and 280Ma, respectively, and a minimum age of 249Ma, based on several zircons around the same age. Analysis of the conodont biofacies and zircon LA-ICP-MS dating of calcareous sandstone indicates that the data is consistent with deposition in the Early Triassic. The Yingshuiquan Formation records Early Triassic shallow-water sediment in the Longmu Co-Shuanghu Palaeo-Tethys, and has a Southern Qiangtang and Northern Qiangtang terranes provenance. During the Early Triassic, the carbonate sediments of the Yingshuiquan Formation were deposited in an active environment around the Longmu Co-Shuanghu Palaeo-Tethys, which has became a residual sea basin.},

   abstract = {The Dabie-Sulu orogen in east-central China is the largest UHP belt in the world. Many studies have dealt with detrital minerals from sedimentary basins surrounding the Dabie belt in order to constrain the tectonic unroofing of this terrane. On the other hand, still few are the works focused on detritals from the basins associated with the Sulu belt The Jiaolai basin, adjacent to the Sulu belt, is made of Mesozoic sedimentary rocks. Two sandstone samples collected from the Early Cretaceous Laiyang Group in the northern and southern margins of the Jiaolai basin were selected for zircon U-Pb dating and trace element analysis. The zircons show main U-Pb age clusters at ca. 2500-2400, 2000-1700, 850-700, and 330-130 Ma, with a minor peak at ca. 1100 Ma and a few Archean ages. Most zircons show texture features reflecting a magmatic origin, whereas several late Paleoproterozoic and Triassic zircons show homogeneous CL images and low Th/U ratios, indicating a metamorphic origin. The Neoproterozoic ages are consistent with the protolith ages of the metamorphic rocks in the Sulu terrane, implying that the Sulu tarrane may be a major source for this component. Whereas most Neoproterozoic zircons are euhedral to subhedral or angular in shape and are not surrounded by overgrowths, this implies that low-grade metamorphic Neoproterozoic metaigneous rocks ocurring along the northern margin of the Sulu terrane or metasediments overlying the HP-UHP rocks in the Sulu terrane might provide source materials to these detrital zircons. The late and early Paleoproterozoic age peaks are consistent with the thermal events occurred in the Jiaobei terrane, slightly younger than those in the Yangtze Block. These suggest that the Jiaobei terrane was a potential source for the Paleoproterozoic to Archean detrital zircon components. Only two early Paleozoic zircon grains were found in the studied samples, indicating the early Paleozoic arc did not extend into the Sulu terrane. According to the distribution of different kinds of rock adjacent to the Sulu terrane, the Early Cretaceous detrital zircons may be potentially derived from Cretaceous plutons from the Sulu belt. Eight detrital zircons including six metamorphic grians and two metamorphic overgrowth rims yield the Triassic ages, which might be derived from HP-UHP rocks from the Sulu terrane. A metamorphic overgrowth rim yields a metamorphic age of 246 +/- 3 Ma, probably recording the timing of the prograde metamorphism of the Sulu terrane. One metamorphic grain yields an age of 212 +/- 2 Ma, which is interpreted to record a retrograde metamorphic event. Based on the REE patterns, the remaining six Triassic analyses can be subdivided into two groups. Four of them record a weighted mean age of 230 +/- 6 Ma and show nearly flat HREE patterns and slight negative or positive Eu anomalies. The last two grains are enriched HREE; considering their ages and the REE patterns, it is suggested that they may originate from other diverse UHP rocks. The Triassic metamorphic zircons were detected in the Laiyang Group, indicating that the Sulu UHP rocks were exposed to the surface before the Early Cretaceous. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

   abstract = {U-Pb detrital zircon geochronology has been used to identify provenance and document sediment delivery systems during the deposition of the early Late Triassic Yanchang Formation in the south Ordos Basin. Two outcrop samples of the Yanchang Formation were collected from the southern and southwestern basin margin respectively. U-Pb detrital zircon geochronology of 158 single grains (out of 258 analyzed grains) shows that there are six distinct age populations, 250-300 Ma, 320-380 Ma, 380-420 Ma, 420500 Ma, 1.7-2.1 Ga, and 2.3-2.6 Ga. The majority of grains with the two oldest age populations are interpreted as recycled from previous sediments. Multiple sources match the Paleozoic age populations of 380-420 and 420-500 Ma, including the Qilian-Qaidam terranes and the North Qilian orogenic belt to the west, and the Qinling orogenic belt to the south. However, the fact that both samples do not have the Neoproterozoic age populations, which are ubiquitous in these above source areas, suggests that the Late Triassic Yanchang Formation in the south Ordos Basin was not derived from the Qilian-Qaidam terranes, the North Qilian orogenic belt, and the Qinling orogenic belt. Very similar age distribution between the Proterozoic to Paleozoic sedimentary rocks and the early Late Triassic Yanchang Formation in the south Ordos Basin suggests that it was most likely recycled from previous sedimentary rocks from the North China block instead of sediments directly from two basin marginal deformation belts.

   abstract = {The tectonic affiliation of the Khanka Massif, in the easternmost section of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB), is still a matter of debate. Here, we provide new constraints on the provenance and timing of deposition of Permian strata in the western margin of the Khanka Massif. The results, which include U-Pb dating of detrital zircon grains using laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS), provide evidence regarding the tectonic position of the Khanka Massif and its role in the late Palaeozoic evolution of the eastern CAOB. Detrital zircon grains from a sublitharenite (Pingyangzhen Formation), a litharenite (Liangzichuan Formation), and a metamorphic siltstone (Qinglongcun Group) yielded multiple age populations ranging from Neoproterozoic (similar to 914 Ma) to Permian (similar to 272 Ma). Combined with age constraints from overlying/late-stage igneous rocks and other magmatism of the Khanka Massif, we conclude that the dated strata were deposited during the early-middle Permian and were sourced from the Khanka Massif. A comparison between the detrital zircon age populations and the history of magmatic activity in the neighbouring areas suggests that the Khanka Massif was tectonically linked to the Songnen-Zhangguangcai Range Massif. Based on tectonic discrimination diagrams, we conclude that the western margin of the Khanka Massif was positioned in a convergent-boundary basin during the early-middle Permian. Strike-slip faulting along the Dunhua-Mishan Fault, in response to ridge subduction of the Paleo-Asian Ocean Plate, resulted in a north-eastward movement of the Khanka Massif. The occurrence of Precambrian detrital zircon grains (with ages of 1900-1700 and 900-700 Ma) implies the presence of an ancient basement within the Khanka Massif.},

The group has been considered as the syn-orogenic product of the Baoshan with Simao-Indochina blocks. However, its depositional time and provenance remain to be poorly constrained. This paper presents zircon U-Pb dating and Lu-Hf-isotopic data for five representative sandstone samples from the Wuliangshan Group. The detrital grains yield a major age-peak at similar to 259 Ma, and four subordinary age-peaks at similar to 1 859, similar to 941, similar to 788, and similar to 447 Ma, respectively. Our results suggest that the Wuliangshan metasedimentary sequence was deposited after Middle Triassic rather than previously-thought Cambrian. The detrital zircon age spectrum, along with in-situ Lu-Hf isotopic data suggest that the Wuliangshan Group might be a syncollisional sedimentary product related to the collision of Baoshan with Simao-Indochina blocks. It is inferred that the provenance of the Wuliangshan Group is mainly from the Simao/Yangtze blocks to the east rather than the Baoshan Block or Lancang igneous zone to the west.},

   abstract = {We report the results of a combined study of detrital zircon U-Pb geochronology and bulk-rock elemental geochemistry on late Neoproterozoic to Cambrian clastic sedimentary rocks from South Jiangxi within Cathaysia. These clastic rocks are characterized by moderate chemical index of alteration (CIA) values of 73 and high Th/U ratios (>3.8), indicating moderate weathering of the source area. The relatively high index of compositional variability (ICV=0.62-1.30) values indicates a source compositionally dominated by immature material that lacks alumina-rich minerals. Bulk-rock major and trace element systematics on discrimination diagrams are consistent with the source provenance being felsic-intermediate igneous rocks of ancient continental crust origin. The geochemistry is also consistent with the clastic sedimentary rocks being deposited in a setting at or in the vicinity of passive continental margins. Detrital zircon U-Pb ages of the clastic rocks record five major age populations: 2,614-2,376Ma (peak at ca. 2,482Ma), 1,953-1,353Ma, 1,000-900Ma (peak at ca. 958Ma), 850-730Ma (peaks at ca. 845 and 763Ma), and 685-571Ma (peak at ca. 635Ma). The age data provide a record of igneous activity in the source provenance: the 2,482Ma peak is consistent with the global Neoarchean continental crust growth; the 1,953-1,353Ma population correlates with the period of assembly and breakup of the Columbia supercontinent; the prominent peak at ca. 958Ma corresponds to a common thermal-tectonic event associated with the assembly of Rodinia, and the 850-730Ma population is consistent with the breakup of the Rodinia supercontinent. The ca. 850Ma age is indicative of initial stage of Rodinia breakup in South China. Our data also reveal a 670-530Ma population that correlates well with the Pan-African event associated with the formation of the Gondwana supercontinent, although no direct geological evidence for this event has been found within the SCB. Moreover, complex zircon morphology and comparisons of detrital zircon U-Pb age spectra in a global context suggest the late Neoproterozoic-Cambrian sedimentary rocks in the Cathaysia Block must have sourced from an exotic source with magmatic activities of late Archean, Grenvillian, and Pan-African ages, which do not outcrop in the Cathaysia Block or adjacent regions and need to be further explored.},

The source rocks for the studied sandstones were dominated by felsic-intermediate materials with moderate weathering history. U-Pb dating results show major populations at c. 2500 Ma, 1000-900 Ma and 870-716 Ma with subordinate peaks at 655-532 Ma, consistent with the global Neoarchean continental crust growth, assembly and break-up of Rodinia, and Pan-African Event associated with the formation of Gondwana. Zircon U-Pb ages and Hf isotopic data suggest that most derived from exotic terranes once connected to the Cathaysia Block. Using whole-rock geochemical analysis, it was determined that the studied sedimentary rocks were deposited in a passive continental margin and the Cathaysia and Yangtze blocks were part of the same continent; no Cambrian ocean existed between them. Compiling a detrital zircon dataset from Qiangtang, northern India, the Lhasa Terrane and Western Australia, the Cathaysia Block seems to be more similar to the Qiangtang and western part of the northern India margin, instead of having a direct connection with the Lhasa Terrane and Western Australia in the Gondwana reconstruction during the late Neoproterozoic and Cambrian eons.},

   abstract = {The Lower Carboniferous Jiujialu Formation bauxite deposits of northern Guizhou Province, China, are a Kazakhstan subtype of karst bauxite deposits. The provenance of the Jiujialu Formation has long been debated, with uncertainty about the formation of the bauxite deposits. Here we report new geochemical data that indicate the affinity between the Lower-Middle Ordovician clastic rocks and argillaceous dolostones and the overlying Carboniferous bauxite deposits, all of which are characterized by high Al2O3, K2O, and sigma REE contents, flat post-Archean Australian shale (PAAS)-normalized REE patterns, and uniform immobile element ratios (TiO2/Al2O3, Nb/TiO2, and Zr/TiO2). Their similar detrital zircon age distributions further indicate the link between the bauxite deposits and the clastic rocks and argillaceous dolostones. Zircon age spectra of clastic rocks of the Lower Silurian Hanchiatien Formation in northern Guizhou match those of the bauxite deposits, with a maximum age peak at similar to 980 Ma and other secondary age peaks, suggesting these clastic rocks may represent the provenance of the bauxite deposits. The youngest detrital zircons (similar to 445 Ma) occur only in the bauxite deposits and are probably sourced from K-bentonite beds of the Ordovician-Silurian transition. Our analyses indicate that the source materials of the bauxite deposits in the Jiujialu Formation are of mixed provenance: Lower-Middle Ordovician aluminosilicate rocks and argillaceous dolostones of the underlying strata, and Lower Silurian clastic rocks and K-bentonite from adjacent areas. A comparison of Early Carboniferous bauxitic provenances in northern and central Guizhou indicates that paleotopography was the major factor controlling the provenance of these bauxite deposits.},

   abstract = {Based mainly on field geological observation and geochronologic data, six tectonic units have been recognized in western Inner Mongolia (China), including, from south to north: North China Craton (NCC), Southern Orogenic Belt (SOB), Hunshandake Block (HB), Northern Orogenic Belt (NOB), South Mongolia microcontinent (SMM), and Southern margin of Ergun Block (SME), suggesting that the tectonic framework of the CAOB in western Inner Mongolia is characterized by an accretion of different blocks and orogenic belts. The SOB includes, from north to south, fold belt, melange, arc-pluton belt, and retroarc foreland basin, representing a southern subduction-collision system between the NCC and HB blocks during 500-440 Ma. The NOB consists also of four units: arc-pluton belt, melange, foreland molasse basin, and fold belt, from north to south, representing a northern subduction-collision system between the HB and SMM blocks during 500-380 Ma. From the early Paleozoic, the Paleo-Asian oceanic domains subducted to the north and the south, resulting in the forming of the SOB and the NOB in 410 Ma and 380 Ma, respectively.

   abstract = {The premise to discuss the evolution of an orogenic belt is to understand the origins and tectonic affinities of various blocks that constitute the orogen. The Baoshan Block in the SE Tibetan Plateau is an ultimate window to observe the orogenic evolution, but its origin and eastern boundary remains debated. In this contribution, we report new detrital zircon U-Pb ages and Hf isotopic data from the Cambrian Baoshan Formation in the middle-western part of the Baoshan Block. Detrital zircon ages range from the Archean to Early Palaeozoic, with age peaks at similar to 2.5, similar to 0.95, and similar to 0.55 Ga. Zircon epsilon(Hf)(t) values exhibit a wide range from negative to positive for each of the three major age groups, indicating diverse magma sources. The eastern boundary for the Baoshan Block should be extended from the Kejie-Nandinghe Fault to the Changning-Menglian suture belt, based on not only comparisons of Early Palaeozoic magmatism, sedimentary facies, and provenances for the Palaeozoic strata that developed on both sides of the Kejie-Nandinghe Fault but also on the regional tectonic framework correlation. The Baoshan Block should be along the Indian margin as the Qiangtang, Tengchong, and Simao-Indochina blocks in Early Palaeozoic according to the provenance analyses.},

   abstract = {The Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB), as one of the largest accretionary orogens in the world, was built up through protracted accretion and collision of a variety of terranes due to the subduction and closure of the Paleo-Asian Ocean in the Neoproterozoic to Early Mesozoic. Located in the Uliastai continental margin of the southeastern CAOB, the Chagan Obo Temple area is essential for understanding the tectonic evolution of the southeastern part of the CAOB and its relation with the "Hegenshan Ocean". In this study, detrital zircon U-Pb geochronology coupled with Hf isotopic analysis was performed on Paleozoic sedimentary strata in this area. Most detrital zircons from the studied samples possess oscillatory zoning and have Th/U ratios of 0.4-1.73, indicative of an igneous origin. Detrital zircons from the Ordovician to Devonian sedimentary strata yield a predominant age group at 511-490 Ma and subordinate age groups at 982-891 Ma, 834-790 Ma and similar to 574 Ma, and have a large spread of epsilon(Hf)(t) values (-20.77 to +16.94). Carboniferous and Early Permian samples yield zircon U-Pb ages peaking at similar to 410 Ma and similar to 336 Ma, and have dominantly positive epsilon(Hf)(t) values (+1.30 to +14.86). Such age populations and Hf isotopic signatures match those of magmatic rocks in the Northern Accretionary Orogen and the Mongolian arcs. A marked shift of provenance terranes from multiple sources to a single source and Hf isotope compositions from mixed to positive values occurred at some time in the Carboniferous. Such a shift implies that the Northern Accretionary Orogenwas no longer a contributor of detritus in the Carboniferous to Early Permian, due to the opening of the "Hegenshan Ocean" possibly induced by the slab rollback of the subducting Paleo-Asian Ocean.

   abstract = {The Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB) was built up through protracted accretion and collision of a variety of terranes/micro-continents during Neoproterozoic-Mesozoic time. To understand potential links among Paleozoic subduction and accretionary processes that were operative during the development of the southeastern CAOB, we conducted a combined U-Pb and Hf-isotope analysis of detrital zircons from previously defined Devonian, Carboniferous and Early Permian strata in the Bengbatu area, Inner Mongolia. Detrital zircons from (meta-) sandstones in these strata commonly yield major Paleozoic age populations at ca. 300-261 Ma, 351-300 Ma and 517-419 Ma, and also give several Precambrian ages that range from 2687 Ma to 544 Ma. The youngest ages redefine the deposition of all these strata to be in the Middle Permian (Wordian-Capitanian) or later, much younger than previously considered. These ages, coupled with regional magmatic records, support an interpretation of most surrounding areas as possible detritus sources, including the Mongolian arcs to the north, the Northern Accretionary Orogen to the south, and the intervening Erenhot-Hegenshan Ophiolite Belt. Zircons with magmatic ages of ca. 500-350 Ma and ca. 300-261 Ma display a large range of epsilon(Hf)(t) values (-13.97 to +15.31), whereas ca. 350-300 Ma zircons are dominated by positive epsilon(Hf)(t) values (+0.14 to +16.00). These results support the occurrence of two significant shifts of the zircon epsilon(Hf)(t)( ) values, which has tectonic implications for the understanding of the Carboniferous-Permian evolution of the southeastern CAOB. A marked shift from mixed to positive zircon epsilon(Hf)(t) values at 350-330 Ma likely manifests the incipient opening of the Hegenshan Ocean, due to the slab rollback of the subducting Paleo-Asian Oceanic lithosphere. Another shift from positive to mixed zircon epsilon(Hf)(t) values at ca. 300 Ma likely corresponds to a tectonic switch from syn-orogenic subduction-related to post-orogenic extensional setting, genetically related to the tectonic collapse of a formerly overthickened crust.

   abstract = {The intra-continental orogeny and tectonic evolution of the Mesozoic Yanshan fold-thrust belt (YFTB) in the northern North China Craton (NCC) have been strongly debated. Here, we focus on the Shangyi basin, located in the centre of the YFTB. An integrated analysis of sedimentary facies, palaeocurrents, clast compositions, and detrital zircon dating of sediments was adopted to determine the palaeogeography, provenance, basin evolution, and intra-continental orogenic process. The Shangyi basin comprises the well-exposed Early-early Middle Jurassic Xiahuayuan Formation and the Longmen Formation, and the Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous Tuchengzi Formation. Based on the 18 measured sections, five facies associations - including alluvial fan, fluvial, delta, lacustrine, and eolian facies - have been identified and described in detail. The onset of the Shangyi basin was filled with fluvial, deltaic, and lacustrine deposits controlled by the normal fault bounding the northern basin, corresponding to the pre-orogeny. In the Middle Jurassic, the cobble-boulder conglomerates of alluvial fan, as molasse deposits, were compatible with the syn-orogeny of the Yanshan movement, which played a critical role in northern North China and even East Asia. After the depositional break in the Middle-Late Jurassic, the Shangyi basin, controlled by the normal fault present in the north of the basin, re-subsided and quickly expanded southward with thick sedimentation, which is correlative with the post-orogeny. Combined with A-type granites, metamorphic core complexes, mafic dikes, and rift basins of the Late Jurassic-early Early Cretaceous present in the northern NCC and Mongolia, significant extension was widespread in the northern NCC and even in northeast Asia. Moreover, vertical changes of provenance indicate that the Taihang Mountain and the Inner Mongolia palaeo-uplift (IMPU) present at the west and north of the basin, respectively, experienced uplift twice in the Middle-Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous, resulting in a regional depositional break.},

   abstract = {Provenances of sedimentary rocks may provide important constraints on the tectonic evolution of the North China Block (NCB). Previous studies have demonstrated that the northern NCB (NNCB) and the Xing-Meng orogenic belt (XMOB) supplied massive detritus southward into the hinterland of the NCB during the Jurassic. In order to study the evolution of sedimentary provenance during the Middle-Late Mesozoic, U-Pb geochronology and Hf isotopic geochemistry of detrital zircon grains and chemical compositions of detrital garnets from sandstones in the Luxi and Jiaolai areas, eastern NCB, were analyzed in combination with published data on the Jurassic sandstones. The Late Paleozoic-Mesozoic (367-139 Ma) zircons in the lowermost Cretaceous Mengyin Formation samples from the Luxi area show epsilon Hf(t) values of -15.3 to -3.2 and +1.3 to +10.0, which are very similar to the results of analyses of the Jurassic formations. Further, the increased amount of Mesozoic zircons and granulite-derived garnets in the Mengyin Formation samples, compared to those in the Jurassic samples, indicates there was more detritus supply from the NNCB than from the XMOB. In the overlying Qingshan Formation samples, zircon grains do not exhibit Paleozoic ages, but most of them have Early Cretaceous ages and negative epsilon Hf(t) values, which are similar to the zircon grains extracted from the widespread Early Cretaceous igneous rocks in the NCB. This suggests that the provenance might have changed to a locally derived source. In contrast, the zircon population of the Early Cretaceous sandstones from the Jiaolai basin is dominated by grains of mid-Neoproterozoic age (700-900 Ma) which signifies contribution from the Sulu orogen. Moreover, the detrital garnet assemblages of sandstones in the Luxi area are not consistent with those from representative metamorphic rocks in the Sulu orogen. The above results seem to confirm that the Mesozoic sedimentary provenance of the Luxi area had no evident connection with the Sulu orogen. Instead, the differential uplifting and exhumation of deep crustal rocks in the NNCB and the XMOB, associated with closure of the Mongol-Okhotsk Ocean, might exert a dominant control on sedimentary provenances in the wide hinterland of the NCB from the Jurassic period to similar to 136 Ma (the upper boundary age of the Mengyin Formation).

   abstract = {Relatively successive sequences of Late Mesozoic are preserved and exposed in Luxi Uplift (LU), eastern North China block (NCB), which is an important region to study the late Mesozoic tectonic evolution of the eastern NCB. In this study, in situ U-Pb ages and Hf isotopic analyses on detrital zircons from the sandstones of Jurassic Fangzi and Santai Formations in LU combining the analysis of sandstone detrital modes were performed, with an aim to trace the Jurassic sediment provenances and the tectonic-paleogeographic configuration of eastern NCB. Three sandstone samples (one from Fangzi Formation and two from Santai Formation) have very similar U-Pb age spectrums which can be divided into three major groups: Phanerozoic (I), Paleoproterozoic (II), and Neoarchean (III). Detrital zircons of Group II and Group III broadly match the age spectra of the basement of NCC which exposed extensively in the northern part. No middle Neoproterozoic magmatic zircons or Triassic metamorphic zircons were found in this study, ruling out the clastic provenance transported from the Sulu orogen to LU. Dominant zircon populations of Group lare Late Paleozoic (250-393 Ma) recording the corresponding magmatic activities which are not found both in LU and its peripheral tectonic terranes, but can be well compared with that of the northern NCB (NNCB) and the Xing-Meng Orogenic Belt (XMOB). Furthermore, Hf isotope compositions of the Phanerozoic detrital zircons can be distinctly divided into two clusters with epsilon(Hf)(t) values ranging from 1.0 to +12.7 and -21.9 to -3.0, respectively resemble those from the XMOB and NCB (mainly from NNCB). Sandstone detrital modes analysis indicates the provenance came from the areas that have been eroded deeply to expose the basement rocks which accords with the tectonic setting of the NNCB. This research proposes that an evident mountain or provenance region once increasingly developed along NNCB during Early to Late Jurassic (182-155 Ma) due to the continuous collision of the Siberia and North China-Mongolian plates, easily shed mass clastic materials southward into the inner NCB and became the major provenance of Jurassic sediments in LU.

   abstract = {The formation time of the Fengshuigouhe (sic) Group in the northwestern Lesser Xing'an Range (sic), NE China, remains controversial owing to the lake of the precise dating data. This article reports zircon U-Pb ages for the leptynite and gneissic granitoids from the Fengshuigouhe Group in the northwestern Lesser Xing'an Range. The aim is to constrain the formation time and provenance of Fengshuigouhe Group. Field observation indicates that the Fengshuigouhe Group consists of a suit of metamorphic rocks (leptynite) and gneissic granitoids intruding the leptynite, and that both of them are cut by late granitic pegmatite. Zircons from two leptynites are euhedral-subhedral in shape and display oscillatory zoning in CL (cathodeluminescence) images. These detrital zircons give weighted mean ages of 255, 291, 321, 361, 469, and 520 Ma. The youngest age of them is interpreted to maximum depositional age of the protoliths of these leptynites. Zircons from gneissic granites are euhedral and subhedral in shape and exhibit typical oscillatory zoning in CL images. The dating results indicate that the gneissic granites were formed in the Early Jurassic (185 +/- 2 Ma). Zircons from the late granitic pegmatite are subhedral in shape and exhibit two types in CL images: structureless and oscillatory zoning. The former gives a weighted mean age of 143 +/- 1 Ma, considered to represent the timing of crystallization of the pegmatite, the latter yield several groups of ages: 178, 273, 319, 482, 611, and 788 Ma, representing the crystallization age of inherited or captured zircons entrained by the pegmatite. Taken together, we conclude that the Fengshuigouhe Group in the northwestern Lesser Xing'an Range formed between Late Paleozoic (255 Ma) to Early Mesozoic (185 Ma), rather than Neoproterozoic as previously believed, and that the sediments in the Fengshuigouhe Group were sourced directly from geological bodies in the study area and adjacent regions.},

   abstract = {The Late Miocene-Pleistocene Gyirong Basin in the central Himalaya provides a record of basin evolution in response to tectonic extension within the active Himalaya orogen. The up to similar to 50-m-thick basin fill can be subdivided, from bottom to top, into four stratigraphic units with distinctly different lithofacies associations: alluvial fan, debris flow, lacustrine-fan delta, and braided river. Analysis of the stratigraphic pattern, provenance, and detrital zircon U-Pb geochronology of the basin fill indicates significant changes of depositional sources and tectonic boundary conditions through time. The alluvial fan deposits in the Oma sub-basin, which unconformably overlie the Tethyan strata, show northward paleoflow directions, detrital zircon U-Pb ages >400 Ma, and low subsidence rates. The unconformably overlying debris conglomerates show westward paleoflow directions, younger detrital zircon U-Pb ages of 15-37 Ma, and high subsidence rates. The abrupt changes in depositional source and tectonic subsidence indicate that the basin evolved from a supradetachment basin related to east-trending northward normal faults in the hanging wall of the South Tibetan Detachment to a rift basin that was mainly controlled by a major north-trending normal fault along the eastern basin margin from similar to 10(-9) Ma onwards. We propose that initial basin formation is the result of N-S extension related to faulting along the South Tibetan Detachment, which was immediately followed by E-W extension of the Himalaya orogen in response to decoupling of the Himalayan crust related to India underthrusting beneath Asia.

   abstract = {The Eastern Block of the North China Craton records Paleoproterozoic oceanic plate subduction, the opening and subsequent closure of a back-arc basin, and a following collisional orogenic event to generate the Jiao-Liao-Ji Belt (JLJB). However, the processes involved in the initiation of subduction remain unclear. This study presents U-Pb age and trace elemental data for detrital zircons from the Langzishan Formation, the lowermost sedimentary unit within the JLJB, to constrain the provenance, depositional age, and depositional environment of this formation as well as the processes involved in the Paleoproterozoic transition in tectonic regime recorded by the Eastern Block. The U-Pb ages of these detrital zircons yield one major age peak at ca. 2529, and three minor age peaks at ca. 2700, ca. 2347, and ca. 2198 Ma. Provenance analysis indicates that the Langzishan Formation was derived from basement rocks in the Longgang Block with minor contributions from early magmatic rocks within the JLJB. Detrital zircon age contribution further suggests that the deposition of the Langzishan Formation was in a passive continental margin and commenced no earlier than 2205 Ma. Combining with previous research on the widespread distribution of magmatic and sedimentary rocks that formed in convergent settings in this area, this study suggests that the Eastern Block records a transition in tectonic regime at ~2205-2170 Ma, from passive continental margin to active continental margin settings, most likely as a result of the re-initiation of global plate tectonic cycling during the early history of the Earth.},

   abstract = {Tectonic transition from the Tethys to Palaeo-Pacific regimes occurred during the Mesozoic in the South China Block. But the switching time and palaeogeographic pattern are still controversial. The Late Triassic to Middle Jurassic Longhai and Sandu basins along the NNE-striking Chaling-Chenzhou-Linwu Fault were selected for provenance analysis and palaeogeographic reconstruction. Detrital zircons of all six samples from the Lower and Middle Jurassic yield peak ages of 250 similar to 400 Ma, 407 similar to 497 Ma, 562 similar to 1,167, 1,603 similar to 2,170 Ma, and 2,270 similar to 2,800 Ma, revealing pre-Triassic tectono-thermal events occurred within or beyond the South China Block. Late Triassic (207 similar to 236 Ma) and Early Jurassic (186 similar to 198 Ma) detrital zircons are also preserved in the Lower and Middle Jurassic. Composition and content variations of zircon ages in the Longhai Basin imply Jurassic stratigraphic inversion, which was caused by Middle Jurassic top-to-the-SE thrusting of the Chaling-Chenzhou-Linwu Fault. Cathodoluminescence images, Th/U ratios, and rare earth elements patterns show that almost all analyzed zircons are of magmatic origin. Y versus U/Yb and Nb/Yb versus U/Yb discrimination diagrams indicate that 250 similar to 400 Ma, 207 similar to 250 Ma, and 186 similar to 198 Ma detrital zircons are continental zircons derived from Late Palaeozoic, Triassic, and Early Jurassic continental arcs, respectively. Provenance analysis indicate that the Middle and Lower Jurassic in the Longhai Basin were derived from the Nanling tectonic belt to the south, whereas the Lower Jurassic in the Sandu Basin from the Wuyishan domain to the east. The source-to-sink systems indicate that an NNE-striking watershed occurred during Early to Middle Jurassic and separated the Longhai and Sandu basins. Tectonic uplift of the NNE-striking watershed resulted from by Late Triassic transpression along the Chaling-Chenzhou-Linwu Fault. Combining these with two-stage tectonic deformation and granitoids in the South China Block, the Mesozoic tectonic transition from the Tethys regime to the Palaeo-Pacific regime occurred during the Late Triassic.},

   abstract = {Detrital provenance analysis is an effective way to understand paleogeographic change and geodynamics. In this paper, we present petrological, whole-rock geochemical and detrital zircon U-Pb geochronological analysis of Early and Middle Jurassic terrestrial clastic rocks in the Jingdezhen Basin and the Huangshan Basin in the Jiangnan domain, South China. Petrology and whole-rock geochemistry show that the source rocks are dominated by intermediate to acid component. The Chemical Index of Alteration ranges from 69 to 86, suggesting a moderate weathering history for the source rocks. The Early-Middle Jurassic sediments in the Jingdezhen and Huangshan basins were mostly sourced from magmatogenic greywackes and felsic magmatic rocks, respectively. Detrital zircons have seven age peaks at similar to 240 Ma, similar to 430 Ma, similar to 1390 Ma, similar to 1880 Ma, similar to 2500 Ma, -3200 Ma and 788-999 Ma (a wide peak). Provenance analysis indicates that the source rocks are in the Jiangnan domain, the Northwest Zhejiang Basin and the Wuyishan domain. Combining these with previous results and paleocurrent directions, we infer that the NE-trending Wuyishan and Xuefengshan domains and the nearly E-W-Jiangnan domain and Nanling tectonic belt were orogenic uplifts and watersheds during the Late Triassic to Middle Jurassic. The Early Mesozoic geodynamics in the South China Block was related to the westward subduction of the PaleoPacific Plate and the northward continent-continent collision following the closure of the Paleo-Tethys Ocean.

   abstract = {Subduction polarity and collisional process are still controversial in the eastern Palaeo-Tethys. On the basis of 1:50,000-scale geological mapping at the Heni Township, zircon U-Pb geochronology and whole-rock geochemistry were analysed for volcano-sedimentary rocks in the eastern Yidun Micro-block, Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Early Palaeozoic sequences were reported firstly in the eastern Yidun Micro-block. Two populations of detrital zircon U-Pb ages (similar to 525 Ma and 800-1,250 Ma) and deformation and metamorphic characteristics imply that the Early Palaeozoic sequences were deposited during the Cambrian to Silurian in the South China Block. The Early Palaeozoic sequences in the eastern Yidun Micro-block were extruded by Cenozoic NW-SE strike-slip faults. Both the Late Triassic upper Tumugou and Lamaya formations yield four prominent peak ages of similar to 260 Ma, similar to 450 Ma, 750 similar to 780 Ma, and similar to 1,850 Ma. U-Pb ages of youngest detrital zircons (226.2 +/- 1.0-224.7 +/- 1.1 Ma), uppermost andestic tuff (216.1 +/- 0.3 Ma) and intruded granitoids (similar to 215 Ma) show that both the upper Tumugou and Lamaya formations were deposited during 225 similar to 216 Ma. Whole-rock geochemistry indicates that all sandstone samples underwent moderate weathering and strong sorting and recycling. They were derived from felsic provenance, like volcano-sedimentary rocks and granitoids in the western Yidun and Qiangtang micro-blocks, indicative of pre-Norian closure of the Jinshajiang Ocean. The closure gave rise to a foreland basin filled by the 225-216 Ma volcano-sedimentary rocks in the eastern Yidun Micro-block. The closure of the Jinshajiang Ocean also led to a scissor-like closure of the Ganze-Litang Ocean by clockwise rotation. Combining these with previous work, the Ganze-Litang Ocean was a back-arc basin resulted from eastward subduction of the Jinshajiang Ocean and had not undergone oceanic subduction.},

The circa 1120 Ma detrital zircons were most likely derived from the Wilkes-Albany-Fraser belt between southwest Australia and Antarctica, whereas the circa 960 Ma detrital zircons could have been sourced from the Rayner-Eastern Ghats belt between India and Antarctica. Derivation of detritus from these sources suggests that south China was located at the nexus between India, Antarctica, and Australia, along the northern margin of East Gondwana during the Cambrian.},

The restriction of Paleozoic detritus to the latter phases of the Kwangsian Orogeny (which started by 460 Ma) suggests progressive exhumation of the Cathaysia Block, perhaps due to thrusting over the Yangtze Block, with the latter remaining a site of active sedimentation during orogenesis.

   abstract = {As the youngest single age of detrital zircons is used as the maximum depositional age, the ages and tectonic attributes of the Late Palaeozoic stratigraphic units in the Tarbagatay area, West Junggar, NW China, become very confusing. An improved statistical approach indicates that 5, 6 and 7 concordant zircons are required for the maximum depositional age at 95% confidence level when the quantity of total concordant zircon in a sample does not exceed 50, 140 and 432, respectively, but the defined maximum depositional age is valid only when it is compatible with geological facts. Otherwise, it is still uncertain if the age is valid. This approach is applied to resolve a chronological chaos in the Late Palaeozoic stratigraphic units in the Tarbagatay area. As a result, the maximum depositional ages obtained from the detrital zircon samples in literature and this study are at 95% confidence level, most of which are well compatible with the fossils in the units, intrusive relationships of plutons to country rocks and ages of interbedded volcanic rocks. The valid maximum depositional ages and other geological facts definitely show the presence of the Devonian, Early Carboniferous and Early Permian stratigraphic units in the Tarbagatay area. The Late Devonian-Early Carboniferous marine-dominated units occurred in the Zharma-Saur arc and its transition to a back-arc basin to the south during the southward subduction of the Irtysh-Zaisan Ocean, whereas the Permian terrestrial unit was formed in a post-collisional setting after the closure of the Irtysh-Zaisan Ocean in the Late Carboniferous.},

   abstract = {There are voluminous ultrahigh pressure-related orthogneisses and minor metamorphic supracrustal rocks in the northeastern Sulu UHP terrane (NSL), East China. The tectonic affinities of the supracrustal rocks are crucial for unravelling the deep continental subduction processes and locating the tectonic suture between the South China (SCB) and North China (NCB) blocks. In this contribution, we report new zircon U-Pb ages and Hf isotope data for the supracrustal rocks and metagabbros in the Zeku region of the NSL. In the Zeku region, the supracrustal rocks are spatially associated with granitic gneisses, metagabbros, and eclogites. Detrital zircon U-Pb analyses yield ages between 3.39 and 0.65 Ga that cluster as three major age populations including (1) 2.15-1.68 Ga with two subpeaks at similar to 1.83 Ga and similar to 1.97 Ga, (2) 2.45-2.15 Ga with a peak at similar to 2.37 Ga, and (3) 0.79-0.65 Ga. In addition, there is a small age population between 3.39 and 2.61 Ga. The youngest age population of 0.79-0.65 Ga indicates that the Zeku supracrustal rocks must have been deposited after 650 Ma rather than during the Palaeoproterozoic as previously thought. The 210-190 Ma metamorphic ages suggest that the Zeku rocks were affected by Triassic collision-subduction and exhumation. Most of the Archaean-Palaeoproterozoic zircons have negative epsilon(Hf)(t) values and two-stage Hf model ages concentrating at 2.4-3.4 Ga (peak at similar to 2.9 Ga), indicating that source rocks of these zircons were mainly derived from recycling of ancient crustal material. These ages, together with the Hf isotopic compositions and rock assemblages, indicate that the Zeku supracrustal rocks were mainly derived from the Precambrian basement rocks of the northern Yangzte Block and have a tectonic affinity to the SCB, rather than the NCB. Our results, together with previously published data, suggest that there are two types of supracrustal rocks with different zircon U-Pb ages and tectonic affinities in the NSL. On the basis of new data, we suggest that the surface boundary between the SCB and NCB in the Jiaodong Peninsula is a complicated tectonic melange zone rather than a single fault.},

The grain size distribution of the sediments displays a clear single-peak feature, indicating the sediments were formed under the same condition of hydrodynamic force. The detrital zircons had Th/U ratios of greater than 0.1, and REE pattern displayed a positive Ce anomaly and a negative Eu anomaly, indicating that these zircons are predominantly of magmatic origin. The U-Pb spectrum of detrital zircons mainly peaked at the Yanshanian (96-185 Ma), Hercynian-Indosinian (222-345 Ma) and Caledonian (421-477 Ma). A portion of the detrital zircons were of Neoproterozoic origin (728-1,003 Ma), which revealed that the basement in the eastern region of Hainan Island was mainly of Neoproterozoic, with rare Archean materials. The positive epsilon (Hf)(t) values (0 to +10.1) of the Neoproterozoic detrital zircons indicated that the juvenile crust grew in the southeastern Hainan Island mainly during the Neoproterozoic period. The Neoproterozoic orogeny in the southeastern part of the island (0.7-1.0 Ga) occurred later than in the northwestern region of the island (1.0-1.4 Ga). Importantly, the Grenvillian orogeny in the southeastern area of Hainan Island shared the same timing with that of the western Cathaysia Block; i.e., both areas concurrently underwent this orogenic event, thereby forming a part of the Rodinia supercontinent. Afterwards, the crust experienced remelting and reworking during the Caledonian Hercynian-Indosinianand Yanshanian accompanied by the growth of a small amount of juvenile crust.},

   abstract = {In situ detrital zircons U-Pb and Hf isotope analyses from the Min and Jiulong River of Southeast China were carried out to identify sediment provenance and crustal evolution of the northeast Cathaysia Block. Detrital zircons from both rivers displayed similar spectrum peaks at 236, 155, and 110 Ma, but samples from the Min River displayed a distinct Caledonian peak (ca. 460 Ma) and contained more Precambrian particles (ca. 1.8 Ga), which likely stemmed from the upstream area of the Wuyishan terrain. Interestingly, because Taiwan Island cannot supply Caledonian and Paleoproterozoic detrital materials and because the Ou and Jiulong River also lack components from these two populations, it is highly likely that the sediment in the western Taiwan coast partially originates from the Min River. The sediments from the Min River in Fujian are also considered the most likely source of the beach sands of western Taiwan (Chen et al. 2006). However, we stress that the 1.8 Ga age source in the western Taiwan sediments was found and recognized. Combining U-Pb dating and Hf-isotope suggests that the northeast Cathaysia Block contains some Neoarchean detrital zircons, which derived from the incorporation of juvenile mantle materials and re-melting of ancient crustal substances. The wide ranges of epsilon(HF)(t) value in the Paleoproterozoic and Neoproterozoic demonstrate the re-melting of ancient crustal materials with minor juvenile mantle materials. Phanerozoic zircons stemmed from re-melting and recycling of Proterozoic crustal materials with or without the invasion of juvenile mantle-derived magmas.},

   abstract = {New age data for the Baoban Complex, South China establishes that it lay outboard of western Laurentia in the early Mesoproterozoic but was not part of the Cathaysia Block, with which it is traditional linked, until the mid-Paleozoic. Our geochronology data for detrital zircon and authigenic monazite grains from metasedimentary rocks indicate accumulation between ca. 1.55 Ga and 1.45 Ga for the Gezhencun succession of the Baoban Complex and ca. 1.45 Ga and 1.30 Ga for the Ewenling succession. The former unit is dominated by detrital zircon populations between 1900 Ma and 1500 Ma with two peaks at 1780 Ma and 1580 Ma. The Ewenling succession has detrital zircon peaks at 1720 Ma and 1450 Ma. Newly discovered gneissic granites were emplaced at 1550 Ma and intruded by 1450 Ma leucogranite dykes that are coeval with 1460-1430 Ma bimodal magmatism. The whole Baoban Complex was metamorphosed over the range of 1.3-0.9 Ga based on ages of authigenic zircon and monazite.
Depositional ages of metasedimentary rocks are coeval with successions of the BeltPurcell Basin, western Laurentia. Detrital zircon from the two regions have similar age populations and Lu-Hf compositions, and display a synchronous provenance shift at ca. 1.45 Ga. Basement lithologies on Hainan Island range in age from ca. 1.55-1.43 Ga and underwent metamorphism during 1.3-0.9 Ga. This is younger than basement rocks on the mainland of the Cathaysia Block in South China, suggesting the two regions are spatially unrelated at this time and hence the Mesoproterozoic record of the island cannot constrain the location of the Cathaysia Block in the Nuna and Rodinia supercontinents.},

   abstract = {The Qilian Orogen, Northwest China, preserves a record of Early to Middle Paleozoic subduction and collision between the Central Qilian Block and North China Craton through closure of the intervening Late Neoproterozoic to Early Paleozoic North Qilian Ocean. Ordovician strata in the Hexi-Corridor Basin document the initial collisional history with a change in tectonic setting from retro-arc to foreland basin. Ages of zircons from the Upper Ordovician strata range from Archean to early Paleozoic with prominent peaks at around 2.5 Ga, 1.6 Ga, 1.0 Ga, and 0.47 Ga. The early Paleozoic ages are consistent with the time of magmatic arc activity related to northward subduction of the Qilian Ocean. Precambrian grains are restricted to the upper part of the sampled sections, with the proportion of Paleozoic grains descending up the section. This trend is interpreted to reflect the gradual termination of subduction zone magmatism and the swamping of the basin by material from the colliding Central Qilian Block and North China Craton. Archean and the early Proterozoic detritus were likely derived from the North China Craton to the north, whereas the Central Qilian Block to the south provided the late Proterozoic grains. Silurian and Devonian strata within the Hexi-Corridor Basin continue to show this mixed source provenance with depositional environment changing from a flysch to molasse setting.

These results suggest the maximum depositional age of the Nanshuangyashan Formation was between the Norian and Rhaetian (206.8 +/- 4.6 Ma, mean standard weighted deviation (MSWD) = 0.17). Whole-rock geochemistry of mudstone indicates that source rocks of the Nanshuangyashan Formation were primarily felsic igneous rocks and quartzose sedimentary rocks, which were mainly derived from the stable continental block and a magmatic arc. Detrital zircon analysis showed the Nanshuangyashan Formation samples recorded four main age groups: 229-204 Ma, 284-254 Ma, 524-489 Ma and 930-885 Ma, and the provenances were attributed to the Jiamusi Block and a Late Triassic magmatic arc near the study area. Furthermore, the eastern Jiamusi Block was a backarc basin, affected by the subduction of the Paleo-Pacific Plate in the Late Triassic, but the magmatic arc related to the subduction near the study area finally died out due to tectonic changes and stratigraphic erosion.},

It was ascertained based on clastic petrology, geochemical analysis, and zircon U-Pb dating that the sedimentary provenances in the eastern Guangdong Basin are mainly felsic igneous rocks from the late Early Jurassic to the Middle Jurassic. The late Early Jurassic Qiaoyuan Formation mainly shows major age peaks at approximately 238 Ma, 259 Ma, and 1858 Ma, and the Middle Jurassic Tangxia Formation shows major age peaks at approximately 169 Ma and 172 Ma. From the late Early Jurassic to the Middle Jurassic in the eastern Guangdong Basin, the source region changes from southwestern South China and southern South China to the eastern Nanling Range. It was determined by comparing the detrital zircon ages of the Qiaoyuan Formation and the Tangxia Formation with those of the late Paleozoic to early Mesozoic basins, and analyzing both the geochemical data and sedimentation, that the eastern Guangdong Basin changed from the basin-arc foreland basin of the late Early Jurassic to the back-arc extension basin of the Middle Jurassic. The changes in early Mesozoic detrital zircon age peaks indicate that the tectonic regime of the eastern Guangdong Basin ended the transformation from the Tethyan tectonic domain to the paleo-Pacific tectonic domain in the early Middle Jurassic (approximately 172 Ma).},

   abstract = {Based on research of the petrology, geochemistry, and zircon U-Pb dating of detrital rocks in the Late Triassic Wenbinshan Formation in southwestern Fujian, and comparing the detrital zircon ages of Wenbinshan Formation with those of Late Paleozoic - Early Mesozoic mam basins in South China, the sedimentary provenance of the Late Triassic in southwestern Fujian and its implications for changes in basin properties are discussed. The research results demonstrate that there is a major age peak at 222 Ma, two subordinate age peaks at 275 Ma and 1851 Ma, and two minor age peaks at 413 Ma and 2447 Ma in the detritaltal zircon age spectra of the upper samples (YGP-6) of the Winnbmshan Formation, whereas there are two major age peaks at 229Ma and 1817 Ma and other minor age peaks 265 Ma, 309 Ma, 415 Ma, 1968 Ma, and 2435 Ma in the detrital zircon age spectra of the lower samples (YGP-26) of the Winnbmshan Formation. The upper samples contain fewer old rietntal zircons than the lower samples, but the upper and lower samples of Winnbmshan Formation are similar in major age composition, which indicates theinmam provenances of the upper and lower sediments are very similar. The source rocks are mainly sedimentary rocks and their provenances are derived from a source area of recycled ornigemc belt and volcanic arc ornigemc belt (acidic island arc). The rietntal zircon composition of the Winnbmshan Formation is mainly composed of Paleoproterozoic zircon and Late Paleozoic - Early Mesozoic zircon. In the Paleoproterozoic, sedimentary provenances were mainly derived from the Wuyi Massif and partly from northwestern Fujian-southwestern Zhejiang. As for the period of Late Paleozoic - Early Mesozoic, the provenances of the Winnbmshan Formation were derived from magmatic active belts of the Early Indosian Epoch of northern South China, eastern South China, and Indosinianian Period of northern South China and coastal areas of eastern South China. The similarities and differences between rietntal zircon age peaks of the Winnbmshan Formation in southwestern Fujian and that of the main basins in South China during the period of Late Paleozoic - Early Mesozoic indicate that from eastern coastal areas of South China to the north and interior of South China, the age composition of basin sediments has changed from simple to relatively complex, and from young sediments to older sediments. There are similarities and differencins in the rietntal zircon compositions of the different basins, which can indicate differencs in the nature of the basins.},

   abstract = {Paleogeographic reconstruction of the Cathaysia Block of South China and its link with orogeny associated with Rodinia and Gondwana remain enigmatic, leading to controversial models proposed for supercontinental configuration. This study presents detailed provenance analysis of late Neoproterozoic to early Paleozoic sedimentary successions from the Cathaysia Block, to trace the sedimentary provenance, that was essentially linked to previously adjacent continents/blocks. Zircon U-Pb dating combined with published paleontological evidence suggests an Ediacaran depositional age range (633-542 Ma) for the Lechangxia Group, while deposition of the Bacun Group most likely commenced during early Cambrian. The older strata were sourced mainly from recycling of quartz rich sedimentary rocks while the younger one received sediments dominantly from felsic igneous rocks. High SiO2 contents (54.6-79.3 wt%) and K2O/Na2O ratios (0.69-35.7), detrital zircon age distribution and abundant monocrystalline quartz indicate a passive setting for Ediacaran and early Cambrian successions. In great contrast, the middle Cambrian strata was likely deposited in collisional setting, considering relatively lower SiO2 contents (67.9-74.5 wt%) and K2O/Na2O ratios (0.97-1.63) plus absence of old zircons. This tectonic transition is consistent with the change from quartz arenite to arkose that could be related to a disconformity between early and middle Cambrian strata. Dominant late Mesoproterozoic detritus (1250-1050 Ma) in the Lechangxia Group was possibly sourced from older Grenville orogens (1300-1050 Ma) in western Australia and East Antarctica because rocks of these ages are rare in the Cathaysia Block. Similarly, abundant early Neoproterozoic clastic (1000-950 Ma) in the late Ediacaran and early Cambrian successions imply an increasing input from younger Grenville orogens (990-950 Ma) in East Antarctica and eastern India. Thus the Cathaysia Block was a part of the East Gondwana assembly and was linked to eastern India, East Antarctica and western Australia during Ediacaran and Cambrian. The source change was coeval with the Pinjarra Orogeny (550-520 Ma) and the early stage of the Kuunga Orogeny (570-550 Ma). In middle Cambrian strata, the middle Neoproterozoic sediments (850-700 Ma) were mainly derived from intrinsic sources, likely to be the Wuyishan terrane. This provenance variation can be linked to the middle Cambrian uplift of the Cathaysia Block in synchronous with the later phase of the Kuunga Orogeny (530-480 Ma).},

   abstract = {The role of the Cathaysia Block, South China, and its linkage with orogenesis in the Rodinia and Gondwana supercontinents remain unresolved because of uncertainties in its paleoposition in supercontinental reconstructions. The lithostratigraphic, geochronologic, geochemical (including isotopic), and paleocurrent data on late Neoproterozoic to early Paleozoic sub-basins in the Cathaysia Block reveal spatio-temporal, tectono-sedimentary, and provenance diversity that show linkages with previously adjacent terranes and orogens in East Gondwana. An abundance of siliceous and conglomeratic rocks, local unconformities, and pinch-out in certain layers indicate a late Cryogenian proximal deposition, late Ediacaran transgression, and Middle Cambrian uplift. Cryogenian to early Ordovician strata contain predominantly 1000-900 Ma (late Grenvillian age) detrital zircon population, whereas 1300-1050 Ma (early Grenvillian age) zircons are only dominant in strata earlier than late Ediacaran. Besides, 850-700 Ma zircons are the most prominent group in the Middle Cambrian strata along with an occasional increase in the 650-500 Ma (Pan-African age) zircons.
The Grenvillian age zircon groups exhibit significant sediment input from the eastern Indian terrane (990-950 Ma) and western Australia (1300-1050 Ma), underlining the fact that the Cathaysia Block was located between these two terranes in the northern part of East Gondwana. The diminishing contribution of early Grenvillian components in the late Ediacaran strata can be linked to the Pinjarra Orogeny (550-520 Ma), which led to uplift that blocked the transport of detritus from Australia. Middle Cambrian provenance variation with high abundance of 850-700 Ma components indicates the presence of intrinsic sediment from the Wuyishan terrane of South China. Given that the Cathaysia Block was a passive continental margin, this change was caused by the uplift of the southeastern Cathaysia Block, which was related to the far-field stress effects of the late phase of the Kuunga Orogeny (530-480 Ma). The decrease in abundance of early Grenvillian and Pan-African zircons in space implies that they were transported into the basins through independent drainage systems. This is consistent with the local and temporal variations in paleocurrent orientations during the Cambrian, further implying diverse and complex drainage systems in the southwestern Cathaysia Block during this period.},

   abstract = {The Qiangtang Basin is the largest Mesozoic marine hydrocarbon-bearing basin in China. Investigating its tectonic and sedimentary evolution is therefore relevant for hydrocarbon exploration. Here we present a detailed stratigraphic and sedimentological analysis of five Jurassic stratigraphic sections in the North Qiangtang Basin. Nineteen facies associations were identified and allowed us to reconstruct changes of water-depth. The North Qiangtang Basin experienced two transgressive-regressive cycles during the Jurassic. The first cycle started in the mid-Jurassic (Bajocian-Bathonian), with braided-river and floodplain sediments passing up-section to tidal flat and eventually inner-to mid-ramp deposits. Tidal-flat deposition resumed during the Callovian. The second cycle began in the Late Jurassic (Oxfordian) with transgressive inner-to mid-ramp sediments followed by a shallowingupward trend during the late Oxfordian, leading again to tidal-flat sedimentation in the Kimmeridgian-Tithonian. Petrographic analysis and detrital-zircon geochronology indicate provenance constantly from the Hoh Xil-Songpan Ganzi terrane, Kunlun arc, and central Qiangtang. Because Jurassic magmatic activity and active syn-depositional faults have not been reported, and steady detrital supply indicates a stable tectonic environment, eustatic change is inferred to represent the principal control on sedimentary evolution in the North Qiangtang Basin during the Jurassic. A comparison with the Amu Darya Basin in central Asia, characterized by similar sedimentological conditions and distribution of reservoir and source rocks, emphasizes the importance of eustatic control for the development of the source-reservoir-seal system of the North Qiangtang Basin.},

The timing of the Jiangnan Orogeny remains controversial. The widespread orogeny-related Neoproterozoic angular unconformity that separates the underlying folded Sibao (ca.1000-820 Ma) and overlying Danzhou (ca.800-720 Ma) Groups was investigated. Six sedimentary samples, below and above the unconformity in three distal localities (Fanjingshan. Madiyi, and Sibao) yield detrital zircon with U-Pb ages ranging from 779 +/- 16 Ma to 3006 +/- 36 Ma, with a prominent peak at ca. 852 Ma. The youngest ages of 832 +/- 11 Ma and 779 +/- 16 Ma arc revealed for the underlying Sibao and overlying Danzhou Groups, respectively. The detrital zircon U-Pb age relative probability plot of the Jiangnan Orogen matches well with those of the Yangtze and Cathaysia blocks since ca. 865 Ma. Integrating geological, geochemical and geochronological results, we suggest that the Paleo-South China Ocean began to subduct under the Yangtze block at ca. 1000 Ma, and was partly closed at ca. 865 Ma. Afterwards, the Yangtze and Cathaysia blocks initially collide at 865 Ma, forming the Jiangnan Orogen. This collision resulted in not only the folding of the Sibao Group, but also sediment deposition in a syn-collisional setting, which makes the upper part of the Sibao Group. The youngest S-type granite dated at ca. 820 Ma that intruded in the Sibao Group marks the late stage of the Jiangnan Orogeny.

However, the tectonic attributes of these two regions remain controversial. In this study we present LA-ICP-MS zircon U-Pb ages, Lu-Hf isotopes, and major and trace elements data from a suite of clastic rocks. Two hundred and forty seven zircon U-Pb ages obtained from the Neoproterozoic meta-sandstones in western Jiangnan Orogen define three major age populations: 2564-2395 Ma, 2068-1849 Ma and 963-730 Ma, corresponding to the early Paleoproterozoic crustal growth, amalgamation of the supercontinent Columbia and tectonics associated with Rodinia. Two hundred and forty three zircon U-Pb age data from Cambrian and Ordovician sandstones in the western Cathaysia yield five age populations: 2626-2392 Ma, 2050-1518 Ma, 1173-904 Ma, 857-708 Ma and 630-502 Ma, which can be correlated to the Neoarchean-early Paleoproterozoic continental growth, the tectono-thermal events associated with the Columbia supercontinent, the assembly and breakup of Rodinia, as well as the Pan-African event. The 630-502 Ma population correlates with the assembly of Gondwana supercontinent during late Neoproterozoic to early Paleozoic, although direct geological evidence for this event has not yet been reported from this region. These results suggest that the western Jiangnan belt and western Cathaysia Block have distinct crustal evolution histories albeit with close affinities. The REE geochemisty and Lu-Hf isotope data also indicate that the provenances of the Neoproterozoic and early Paleozoic detritus in western Jiangnan belt and western Cathaysia are mostly composed of reworked crustal materials. The metamorphic rims of zircon grains with core-rim structures yield ages of 912-891 Ma and 853-835 Ma, suggesting two phases of metamorphic events during Neoproterozoic in the source areas. These two events are likely associated with the tectonics related to the collision of Yangtze and Cathaysia blocks in the western and eastern segments, respectively. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The detrital zircon results from this study do not fit with this model and instead show provenance consistent with a river draining a watershed within the Songpan-Garze Complex, most likely from the northeast. From the late Oligocene and thereafter zircon provenance records greater contributions from erosion of local sources that surround the basin including the South China Block and Yidun Arc rocks that suggest loss of the northern sources. The timing for these changes overlap with regional deformation related to strike-slip faulting or displacement by shear strain rather than the later uplift associated with an expanding margin of the Tibetan Plateau.},

The results imply a provenance of the sediment from the North China Craton and Dabie Orogen for the Upper Triassic to Middle Jurassic sandstones and from the Indosinian granitic plutons in the South China Craton for the Lower Cretaceous sandstones. The 90-120 Ma age group in the Upper Cretaceous sandstones in the Hengyang Basin is correlated with Cretaceous volcanism along the southeastern margin of South China, suggesting a coastal mountain belt have existed during the Late Cretaceous.

   abstract = {Single grain U-Pb ages of sediments from the Beipiao Basin, Northeast China were conducted to determine the evolution of basin provenance. Zircons from a sandstone in the Upper Triassic Laohugou Formation yield a wide range of ages and, according to their U-Pb ages, fall into four groups: 209.3 +/- 4.0-304.2 +/- 4.9, 1565.5 +/- 71-2154 +/- 50, 2400 35-2499 +/- 9, 2512 +/- 11-2557 +/- 74 Ma. These ages indicate that the zircons were principally derived from Late Archean, Proterozoic and Late Paleozoic plutonic rocks. Intrusions in the Mongolian Accretion Belt and the northern margin of the North China Block (NCB) were probably the main source of the sediments in the basin, but the easterly Liaodong Block also provided minor detrital material, with lower U-Pb ages, during the Late Triassic. Most of the U-Pb ages from zircons collected from a sandstone in the Lower Jurassic Beipiao Formation range from 194.3 +/- 2.9 to 233.8 +/- 4.2 Ma, reflecting the major sediment source during the Early Jurassic. Zircons derived from Late Indosinian plutonic rocks increased, which suggests that the detritus was supplied mainly from the interior of the Yan-Liao Orogenic Belt, especially from the Liaodong Block. Late Indosinian zircons (200-230 Ma) were eroded and deposited in the Lower Jurassic Beipiao Formation, and this implies that intensive tectonic activation and uplift of the Yan-Liao Orogenic Belt in the Mesozoic commenced in the Late Indosinian.

   abstract = {The mode and tempo of Cenozoic fluvial input into the South China Sea by Asian rivers were strongly controlled by tectonically induced topographic changes and landscape development that resulted in repeated river captures and reversals. New Nd isotope and U-Pb detrital zircon data from clastic sedimentary sequences in the northern South China Sea display secular variations reflecting significant changes in the compositions of fluvial sediment as well as changes in source rocks. The oldest, Eocene-Oligocene (before similar to 25 Ma) clastic rocks of the South China Sea contain sediments with epsilon(Nd) values of 25 to -7.5 and detrital zircons of Cretaceous, Jurassic, and Permo-Triassic, all derived from southern Cathaysia. The Oligocene-Middle Miocene (similar to 25-11 Ma) sediments in the South China Sea strata display epsilon(Nd) values of 212 to 214 and Archean, Proterozoic, and Paleozoic detrital zircons, suggesting northern Cathaysia and/or the Yangtze Blocks as their provenance. The headward expansion of the Pearl River and reversal of the Middle Yangtze River correlates with the opening of the South China Sea and growth of the eastern Tibetan Plateau at similar to 25 Ma. Further uplift of the eastern Tibetan Plateau and the Wuyi-Nanling Mountains in SE China around 11 Ma reshaped the landscape and caused another phase of erosion-pattern adjustment and drainage-divide migration in East Asia, leading to the establishment of the modern fluvial systems of the Pearl, Minjiang, and Lower Yangtze Rivers.
Plain Language Summary The mode and tempo of Cenozoic fluvial input into the South China Sea by Asian rivers were strongly controlled by tectonically induced topographic changes and landscape development that resulted in repeated river captures and reversals. This study reconstructs tectonic topography changes and drainage development over 30 million years using Nd isotope and single grain zircon U-Pb data from the South China Sea. Our study shows that tectonic topography and river systems in East Tibet experienced two major reorganization events, reflecting the protracted and episodic growth of eastern Tibet, East Asia marginal seas, and Asian monsoonal climate. Our findings shed light on how tectonic, climate, and river drainage processes have interacted in this part of the world during the latter part of the Cenozoic. We believe our work is international interest and contributed to unravel the history of tectonic topographic evolution and drainage development through time in eastern Tibet.},

   abstract = {The Neoproterozoic Hualong Complex dominates the South Qilian terrane. It contains mafic to felsic magmatic rocks, cherts and turbiditic sediments, some of which have been metamorphosed to amphibolite grade and is traditionally regarded as a pre-Cambrian micro-continental block rifted from the South China plate. New U-Pb geochronology of morphologically complex zircons sheds light on the history of the complex. Garnet-bearing amphibolite and quartzite have detrital zircon U-Pb main peak ages of 1.47-1.78 Ga with youngest U-Pb ages of 967 Ma and 964 Ma. They are intruded by Neoproterozoic orthogneisses that crystallized between ca. 850 and 940 Ma. Psammitic paragneisses are dominated by 940-780 Ma detrital zircon populations with a youngest U-Pb weighted mean age of 721 +/- 3 Ma and a main peak at 906 Ma. Metamorphic overgrowths on older zircons record amphibolite fades metamorphism of the Hualong Complex and correspond to the emplacement of the younger plutonic rocks during the Early Paleozoic northward subduction of Proto-Tethyan oceanic lithosphere. 426 Ma and 455 Ma detrital zircon populations that originated from synkinematic granitoids dominate quartz-mica schist. Negative to positive epsilon(Hf)(t)values for both 940-850 Ma granitic orthogneisses and intruding 460-410 Ma granites suggest a crustal-mantle mixture source. Hf T-DM1 model ages and inherited zircon U-Pb ages are the same as those for garnet-bearing amphibolites and psammitic gneiss indicating that late magmatic rocks were formed by melting of the accreted Neoproterozoic rocks.

Knowledge of the provenance and tectonic setting of a thick succession of E-W striking Devonian sedimentary rocks sandwiched tectonically between the Shangdan and Mianlue ophiolitic suture zones in this belt is essential to understanding the evolution of the Qinling Orogen and the assembly of the North China and Yangtze plates during the Late Paleozoic. Systematic studies of the Devonian sedimentary facies in the Xiqingshan Mountains indicate the northern margin of the South Qinling belt was uplifted prior to the Early Devonian. Lower Devonian sandstones are dominated by feldspathic litharenite (Q(12-31)F(18-37)L(40-65)), indicative of a continental arc derivation. Detrital zircon U-Pb data demonstrate that the Lower and Middle Devonian sandstones were derived respectively from ca. 770 Ma and ca. 400 Ma felsic arc-related magmatic sources.

   abstract = {Lower to Middle Triassic clastic rocks in the West Qinling Mountains along NE margin of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau are generally regarded as part of the Songpan-Ganzi flysch Basin. However relatively little attention has been paid to the age and provenance of these units. New petrological and geochemical results demonstrate that these sediments accumulated along an active continental margin and are dominated by feldspathic litharenite and lithic arkose with low mineral and compositional maturity. They were derived primarily from a continental arc source dominated by intermediate to felsic igneous rocks, with a minor contribution from older metamorphosed and sedimentary sources. Turbidite samples yielded two primary detrital zircon U-Pb age populations of ca. 273 Ma and ca. 435 Ma, which is different from the Early Triassic (ca. 252 Ma) and Middle Silurian (ca. 427 Ma) age populations that dominate the Songpan-Ganzi Basin. These data together with paleocurrent results indicate that the South Qilian Belt was the primary source origin because this belt contains both early Paleozoic Andean-type igneous and magmatic rocks and has a basement of Precambrian metamorphosed rocks. Regionally, an Andean-type arc traverses the South Qilian belts and extends into the West Qinling Mountains and Kunlun Orogen, which formed by north-directed subduction of the Paleo-Tethyan Ocean during the Early to Middle Triassic. Voluminous detritus that originated from the Qilian and Kunlun orogens as they were uplifted and eroded was transported to the south and deposited in the forearc area in front of the A'nimagen-Mianlue suture.},

   abstract = {The Sichuan Basin and the Songpan-Ganze terrane, separated by the Longmen Shan fold-and-thrust belt (the eastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau), are two main Triassic depositional centres, south of the Qinling-Dabie orogen. During the Middle-Late Triassic closure of the Paleo-Tethys Ocean, the Sichuan Basin region, located at the western margin of the Yangtze Block, transitioned from a passive continental margin into a foreland basin. In the meantime, the Songpan-Granze terrane evolved from a marine turbidite basin into a fold-and-thrust belt. To understand if and how the regional sediment routing system adjusted to these tectonic changes, we monitored sediment provenance primarily by using detrital zircon U-Pb analyses of representative stratigraphic samples from the south-western edge of the Sichuan Basin. Integration of the results with paleocurrent, sandstone petrology and published detrital zircon data from other parts of the basin identified a marked change in provenance. Early-Middle Triassic samples were dominated by Neoproterozoic (similar to 700-900 Ma) zircons sourced mainly from the northern Kangdian basement, whereas Late Triassic sandstones that contain a more diverse range of zircon ages sourced from the Qinling, Longmen Shan and Songpan-Ganze terrane. This change reflects a major drainage adjustment in response to the Late Triassic closure of the Paleo-Tethys Ocean and significant shortening in the Longmen Shan thrust belt and the eastern Songpan-Ganze terrane. Furthermore, by Late Triassic time, the uplifted northern Kangdian basement had subsided. Considering the eastward paleocurrent and depocenter geometry of the Upper Triassic deposits, subsidence of the northern Kangdian basement probably resulted from eastward shortening and loading of the Songpan-Ganze terrane over the western margin of the Yangtze Block in response to the Late Triassic collision among Yangtze Block, Yidun arc and Qiangtang terrane along the Ganze-Litang and Jinshajiang sutures.},

   abstract = {Middle Neoproterozoic sedimentary rocks are widespread in the South China Block, especially around the periphery of the Yangtze Block. They are separated into the Sibao and Danzhou groups (and their equivalents) by a "mid-Neoproterozoic angular unconformity" in the south margin of the Yangtze Block. This unconformity, previously interpreted as the evidence of continental collision between the Yangtze and Cathaysia blocks, is crucial for understanding the early-middle Neoproterozoic tectonic regime in the South China Block. We report integrated in situ U-Pb, Hf and O isotopes analyses of detrital zircon grains from sandstones across this unconformity, and use these data to decipher their sedimentary provenances and shed new light on the basin evolution and the tectonic significance of this mid-Neoproterozoic unconformity. A total of 324 concordant U-Pb zircon analyses are obtained from three sandstone samples, including two from the Yuxi Formation of the Sibao Group and one from the Baizhu Formation of the Danzhou Group that are located below and above the unconformity, respectively. Detrital zircon grains from the lower part of the Yuxi Formation are dominated by a single age population peaked at ca. 830 Ma, providing a maximum depositional age for the formation. Zircon grains from the middle part of the Yuxi Formation and the lowest part of the Baizhu Formation have very similar, "multi-peaked" age patterns, with five distinctive peaks at ca. 840 Ma, ca. 940 Ma, ca. 1620 Ma, ca. 1850 Ma and ca. 2500 Ma, and zircon grains within the youngest age population are of the similar Hf-O isotopic features in the two samples, indicating that sediments across the mid-Neoproterozoic unconformity share similar sedimentary provenances and deposited within the similar tectonic setting. Appearance of abundant low-delta O-18 magmatic zircon grains from these sediments is coincident with regional intraplate anorogenic magmatism at ca. 850 Ma, suggesting that both the Sibao and Danzhou groups were most likely deposited in a continental rift basin. Thus, this study strongly argues against the orogenic origin of the regional mid-Neoproterozoic unconformity between them. Our new data suggest that the mid-Neoproterozoic unconformity is likely attributed to a rapid regional crust uplifting (associated with widespread mafic and granitic magmatism), unroofing and basin subsidence related to the proposed mantle plume activity at ca. 825 Ma.

   abstract = {The Liaodong Paleoproterozoic orogenic belt (LPOB), as part of the eastern North China Craton (NCC), is the result of global collision during the amalgamation of the Columbia supercontinent. Tectonics of the LPOB thus becomes the key to the understanding of the tectonic evolution of the NCC, and may provide important information on the assembly of the supercontinent. Detailed geochronological and geochemical analysis on detrital zircons from the Liaohe group is conducted to unravel the tectonic attribute of the major constituent, i.e., the Liaohe group within the LPOB. The results show that the U-Pb ages of detrital zircons from the Langzishan, Li'eryu, Gaojiayu and Dashiqiao formations at the middle-lower parts of the Liaohe group are mainly characterized by peaks at similar to 2500 and 2200-2100 Ma. However, the ages of detrital zircons from the Gaixian formation at the upper part are peaked at 2100-2000 Ma. The age data indicate that the Archean basement rocks and Paleoproterozoic magmatic activities at 2200-2100 Ma variably provide sources for sediments of the middle-lower Liaohe group. However, sediments of the Gaxian formation at the upper part of the Liaohe group are mainly derived from magmatic activities from the Nangrim and North Gyeonggi blocks at 2100-2000 Ma. The source characteristics of the Liaohe group highlight the importance of back-arc extension in the evolution of the LPOB. The tectonic evolution of the LPOB is, therefore, subdivided into four stages, i.e. early back-arc extension stage (2200-2080 Ma), transitional stage (2080-1940 Ma), main orogenic deformation (1940-1840 Ma) and post-orogenic plutonic emplacement (after 1840 Ma).},

   abstract = {This paper reports LA-ICP-MS U-Pb dates and in situ Hf isotope analyses of detrital zircons from the Mesozoic basins in western Shandong, China, with the aim to constrain the depositional ages and provenances of the Mesozoic strata as well as the Mesozoic tectonic evolution of the eastern North China Block (NCB). The Mesozoic strata in western Shandong, from bottom to top, include the Fenghuangshan, Fangzi, Santai and Wennan formations. Most of the analyzed zircon grains exhibit oscillatory growth zoning and have relatively high Th/U ratios (generally 0.2-3.4), suggesting a magmatic origin. Zircons from the Fenghuangshan Formation in the Zhoucun Basin yield six main age populations (2489, 1854, 331, 305, 282, and 247 Ma). Zircons from the Fangzi Formation in the Zhoucun and Mengyin basins yield eight main age populations (2494, 1844, 927, 465, 323, 273, 223, and 159 Ma) and ten main age populations (2498, 1847, 932, 808, 540, 431, 315, 282, 227, and 175 Ma), respectively, whereas zircons from the Santai Formation in the Zhoucun and Mengyin basins yield nine main age populations (2519, 1845, 433, 325, 271, 237, 192, 161, and 146 Ma) and six main age populations (2464, 1845, 853, 277, 191, and 150 Ma), respectively. Five main age populations (2558, 1330, 609, 181, and 136 Ma) are detected for zircons from the Wennan Formation in the Pingyi Basin. Based on the youngest age, together with the contact relationships among formations, we propose that the Fenghuangshan Formation formed in the Early-Middle Triassic, the Fangzi Formation in the Middle-Late Jurassic, the Santai Formation after the Late Jurassic, and the Wennan Formation after the Early Cretaceous. These results, together with previously published data, indicate that: (1) the sediments of the Fenghuangshan Formation were sourced from the Precambrian basement and from late Paleozoic to early Mesozoic igneous rocks in the northern part of the NCB; (2) the sediments of the Fangzi and Santai formations were sourced from the Precambrian basement, late Paleozoic to early Mesozoic igneous rocks in the northern part of the NCB, and the Sulu terrane, as well as from Middle-Late Jurassic igneous rocks in the southeastern part of the NCB; and (3) the Wennan Formation was sourced from the Tongshi intrusive complex, the Sulu terrane, and minor Precambrian basement and Early Cretaceous igneous rocks. The evolution of detrital provenance indicates that in the Early-Middle Triassic, the northern part of the NCB was higher than its interior; during the Late Triassic to Early Jurassic, the eastern NCB was uplifted, resulting in a period of non-deposition; and an important transition from a compressional to an extensional tectonic regime occurred during the Middle-Late Jurassic. The presence of Neoproterozoic and Triassic detrital zircons in the Fangzi Formation sourced from the Sulu terrane suggests that large-scale sinistral strike-slip movement along the Tan-Lu Fault Zone did not occur after the Middle Jurassic (ca. 175 Ma).

Samples of upper Paleozoic to Mesozoic strata were obtained from the Taiyuan, Xiashihezi, Shangshihezi, Shiqianfeng, Ermaying, Shangyoufangzhuang, Upper Jurassic unnamed, and Lower Cretaceous unnamed formations (from oldest to youngest). On the basis of the youngest zircon ages, combined with the age-diagnostic fossils, and volcanic interlayer, we propose that the Taiyuan Formation (youngest zircon age of 439 Ma) formed during the Late Carboniferous and Early Permian, the Xiashihezi Formation (276 Ma) during the Early Permian, the Shangshihezi (376 Ma) and Shiqianfeng (279 Ma) formations during the Middle-Late Permian, the Ermaying Group (232 Ma) and Shangyoufangzhuang Formation (230 and 210 Ma) during the Late Triassic, the Jurassic unnamed formation (154 Ma) during the Late Jurassic, and the Cretaceous unnamed formation (158 Ma) during the Early Cretaceous. These results, together with previously published data, indicate that: (1) Upper Carboniferous-Lower Permian sandstones were sourced from the Northern Qinling Orogen (NQO); (2) Lower Permian sandstones were formed mainly from material derived from the Yinshan-Yanshan Orogenic Belt (YYOB) on the northern margin of the NCC with only minor material from the NQO; (3) Middle-Upper Permian sandstones were derived primarily from the NQO, with only a small contribution from the YYOB; (4) Upper Triassic sandstones were sourced mainly from the YYOB and contain only minor amounts of material from the NQO; (5) Upper Jurassic sandstones were derived from material sourced from the NQO; and (6) Lower Cretaceous conglomerate was formed mainly from recycled earlier detritus. The provenance shift in the Upper Carboniferous-Mesozoic sediments within the study area indicates that the YYOB was strongly uplifted twice, first in relation to subduction of the Paleo-Asian Ocean Plate beneath the northern margin of the NCC during the Early Permian, and subsequently in relation to collision between the southern Mongolian Plate and the northern margin of the NCC during the Late Triassic. The three episodes of tectonic uplift of the NQO were probably related to collision between the North and South Qinling terranes, northward subduction of the Mianlue Ocean Plate, and collision between the Yangtze Craton and the southern margin of the NCC during the Late Carboniferous-Early Permian, Middle-Late Permian, and Late Jurassic, respectively. The southern margin of the central NCC was rapidly uplifted and eroded during the Early Cretaceous. (C) 2017 International Association for Gondwana Research. Published by Elsevier B.V.

   abstract = {The tectonic evolution of the North China Craton (NCC) from the Late Mesoproterozoic to the Neoproterozoic has been unclear. This paper reports the results of LA-ICP-MS U-Pb dating and in situ Hf isotope analysis of detrital zircons from Neoproterozoic strata in the northern Jiangsu and southern Liaoning provinces of southeastern NCC, and we go onto discuss how these results help constrain the Late Precambrian evolution of the NCC. Most analyzed zircon grains exhibit oscillatory growth zoning, and they have relatively high Th/U ratios (>0.4) and positive Ce anomalies as well as negative Eu anomalies, all of which suggests a magmatic origin. The detrital zircons from the Xinxing and Jinshanzhai formations in northern Jiangsu Province give weighted mean ages of 1753, 1635, 1486, and 1121 Ma. and 2515, 2305, 1856, 925, and 825 Ma, respectively, and the detrital zircons from the Diaoyutai and Xingmincun formations in southern Liaoning Province give ages of 1745, 1619, 1484, 1175, and 1077 Ma, and 1798, 1623, 1150, 1020, and 934 Ma, respectively. These results, together with previously published ages, indicate that (1) the Neoproterozoic strata in the northern Jiangsu and southern Liaoning provinces were deposited during a period from the Late Mesoproterozoic to Neoproterozoic, and (2) the sediments in the Neoproterozoic strata were sourced mainly from igneous rocks of Late Paleoproterozoic, Mesoproterozoic, and Early Neoproterozoic age, as well as from the ancient Precambrian basement of the NCC. The concordia plots for 291 detrital zircon grains give three prominent age groups of 1.86-2.5, 1.5-1.8, and 0.9-1.2 Ga. The detrital zircon ages of 1.86-2.5 Ga in the Neoproterozoic strata tie in with most of the Precambrian tectonic-magmatic-thermal events that occurred in the NCC. Zircon ages of 1.6-1.8 Ga can be linked to rift magmatism of Late Paleoproterozoic age in the NCC. The detrital zircon ages of 0.9-1.2 Ga can be related to Grenville-aged magmatism in the southeastern NCC. The zircons show negative epsilon(Hf) (t) values (-8.8 to -0.1), suggesting that the source rocks were dominated by reworked ancient Precambrian crust. The positive epsilon(Hf) (t) values (+0.3 to +10.8) and Hf model ages indicate that growth of continental crustal occurred at similar to 2.7 Ga, similar to 1.9 Ga, and similar to 1.5 Ga in the southeastern NCC.

   abstract = {Junggar basin is an important part of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB) which is also one of the key areas of researches about formation and evolution of the CAOB. Recently, a question of whether the Junggar basin has a Precambrian basement is one of the hottest topics. We undertook LA-ICP-MS zircon U-Pb dating from Carboniferous pyroclastic rocks and Mesozoic sedimentary rocks in northern Xinjiang Province, NW China, with the aim of constraining the evolution and features of the basement of the north Junggar basin and adjacent areas. (1) The zircon U-Pb age analysis of the Carboniferous pyroclastic rock samples clustered in the 1447 similar to 1410 Ma and 885 similar to 559 Ma showed that the basement of the north Junggar basin was continental crust that formed 1.4 Ga ago. The zircon U-Pb ages clustered in the 536 similar to 420 Ma, 401 similar to 360 Ma, and 359 similar to 303 Ma indicated a multiple evolution of basement. (2) The zircon trace element analysis of different age groups from the Carboniferous pyroclastic rock samples showed that the basement of the north Junggar basin was continental crust composed of acid rocks and intermediate-basic intrusive rocks, which were mainly the granitoids, syenite, basalt, dolerite, and larvikite. (3) The zircon U-Pb ages and trace element analysis of the Mesozoic sedimentary rock samples clustered in the 3022 similar to 2102 Ma, 1747 similar to 1202 Ma, 996 similar to 915 Ma, 885 similar to 544 Ma, 539 similar to 420 Ma, 419 similar to 356 Ma, and 354 similar to 300 Ma revealed that not only 3.0-Ga continental crust existed in the north Junggar basin and adjacent areas but also multiple crustal material evolution that occurred during the formation of the basement. (4) The evolution of sedimentary cover experienced 299 similar to 250 Ma, 210 similar to 176 Ma, 175 similar to 148 Ma, and 147 similar to 132 Ma with the corresponding peak age of ca. 290, 180, 163, and 140 Ma, respectively, indicated that the sedimentary cover of the northern Junggar basin experienced a complex tectonic evolution from Permian.},

   abstract = {The Huangshi foreland basin developed on the southern margin of the Dabie Mountains as a result of tectonic loading during Triassic collisional suturing between the North China and South China cratons. Modal and detrital zircon data for Jurassic samples within the basin suggest a multicomponent source with input from both the South China Craton and Dabie Orogen. Samples are predominantly quartz arenites derived, on the basis of framework compositions, from a recycled orogen source. Detrital zircons range in age from Archean to Triassic with a dominant component in the late Paleoproterozoic between 1.9-1.7 Ga and subsidiary components at 2.6-2.2 Ga, 0.8-0.7 Ga, 0.5-0.4 Ga, and 0.33-0.2 Ga. Age data integrated with cathodoluminescence and trace element data for the zircons indicate that the Archean and Proterozoic detritus was derived from igneous and metamorphic sources that overlap with time-equivalent pulses of such activity within the South China Craton. Phanerozoic zircon ages overlap the times of the Ordovician, Carboniferous and Triassic high-pressure metamorphism in the Dabie Mountains. The provenance record, integrated with paleocurrent and regional relations, enables a paleogeographic reconstruction in which the Huangshi Basin was fed by a major axial flowing trunk river system carrying detritus from eastern and southern sources within the South China Craton and was also fed by short south flowing tributaries supplying some detritus from the evolving Dabie Orogen. The dominance of cratonic-derived detritus within the provenance record of the Huangshi Basin contrasts with that of the Hefei foreland basin that lies to the north of the Dabie Mountains, which is dominated by Neoproterozoic - Mesozoic detritus derived directly from the Dabie Mountains and lacks any significant older Paleoproterozoic or Archean components. Easterly extensions of the Dabie-Sulu collisional suture and of the resultant Huangshi Basin occur in Korea and Japan over an along strike length of some 2000 km. Citation: Yang, J., P. A.

   abstract = {Sandstone petrology, geochemistry, and detrital zircon U-Pb ages and trace elements are integrated to investigate the provenance of Middle Triassic strata from the Youjiang Basin, SW China. Variations in abundance of volcanic lithic fragments and ratios of Th/U, Zr/Sc and Th/Sc suggest that sandstones from the southwestern portion of the basin display less sedimentary recycling and have a lower felsic average source composition than time-equivalent strata from the central, eastern and northern portions of the basin. All sandstones exhibit an overall similar detrital zircon U-Pb age distribution pattern with major age groups at 1200-900 Ma, 480-420 Ma and 300-240 Ma together with some Devonian-Carboniferous and Neoproterozoic grains. Combined with the compiled paleocurrents, the detrital zircon ages suggest multiple-sourced components. Pre-Devonian detrital zircons were likely derived from the recycled late Neoproterozoic-early Paleozoic clastic rocks and from magmatic and metamorphic rocks related to the early Paleozoic orogeny in the southeastern segment of the South China Craton. Late Paleozoic-Triassic detrital zircons together with the presence of well preserved volcanic lithic fragments were considered to indicate first-cycled detrital input from a subduction-collisional mountain belt to the southwest of the craton. These provenance data argue for an Indosinian mountain building event following the closure of a Paleo-Tethys branch ocean rather than for a thermotectonic reactivation event as recently proposed for the Indosinian orogeny in the southwestern China. In association with this orogeny the Youjiang Basin evolved into a foreland basin. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Clastic sedimentary rocks are samples of the exposed continental crust. In order to characterize the crustal growth history of North China and its possible regional variations, 479 concordant detrital zircons in three sand samples from the lower reach of the Yellow River (which drains the Tibet-Qinghai Plateau, the Western Qinling Orogen, the Qilian Orogen and the North China Craton) and two sand samples from the Luan River and the Yongding River (which run entirely within the North China Craton) were measured for U-Pb age and Lu-Hf isotopic compositions by excimer laser-ablation ICP-MS and MC-ICP-MS. Although regional variations exist, concordant detrital zircons from the Yellow River reveal three major age groups of 2.1-2.5 Ga, 1.6-2.0 Ga, and 150-500 Ma. Detrital zircons from the smaller Luan and Yongding Rivers show three broadly similar major age groups at 2.3-2.6 Ga, 1.6-2.0 Ga, and 140-350 Ma, but with narrower age ranges. Compared to the Luan and Yongding River zircons, the Yellow River zircons are characterized by a significant number of Neoproterozoic grains. Although Hf isotopic compositions show both juvenile crustal growth and crustal reworking for all age groups, much of the crustal growth of North China occurred in the Neoarchean and Mesoproterozoic. All three rivers are characterized by a common prominent group of Hf crust formation model ages at 2.4-2.9 Ga with a peak at 2.7-2.8 Ga. A less significant age group lies between 1.4 and 1.8 Ga for the Yellow River, and between 1.6 and 1.9 Ga for the Yongding River and Luan River. Crustal growth rates based on Hf continental crust formation model ages suggest 45% and 90% of the present crustal volume was formed by 2.5 Ga and 1.0 Ga, respectively, for the drainage area of the Yellow River. In comparison, 60% and 98% of the present crustal volume of the North China Craton was generated by 2.5 Ga and 1.0 Ga, respectively, for the Luan and Yongding Rivers. The 2.7-2.8 Ga age peak observed in all river samples agrees well with the coeval major peak for global crustal growth. However, the other suggested global peaks of crustal growth at 3.4 and 3.8 Ga are insignificant in North China. Taken together with our previous studies of the Yangtze Craton, which show insignificant crustal growth at 2.7-2.8 Ga, we suggest that these advocated worldwide crust formation peaks be re-examined and treated carefully. Our results also show that Phanerozoic zircons may have been derived from crustal sources separated from the mantle up to 2.0 Ga ago before the zircons crystallized, suggesting long-term preservation, reworking and recycling of the continental crust.

   abstract = {The Simao block, northern extension of Indochina block, was located along the Proto-Tethyan subduction zone in Early Paleozoic and subducted by the Paleo-Tethyan Ailaoshan ocean along its eastern margin in Permo-Triassic. The location of Simao block in the Proto-Tethyan paleogeography and the Permo-Triassic consumption process of the Ailaoshan ocean were unclear. Detrital zircons from Silurian to Triassic strata and the representative Xin'anzhai intrusion in the eastern margin of Simao block are studied to constrain the Proto- to Paleo-Tethyan evolution. The major age peaks of detrital zircons in Early Silurian-Early Devonian strata are similar to 0.95 Ga and similar to 0.45 Ga, which are consistent with those of detrital zircons in the time-equivalent strata in the Simao-Indochina block rather than Yangtze block. This implied that the Paleo-Tethyan suture of the Ailaoshan ocean was located along the Ailaoshan-Tengtiaohe fault. The dominant and diagnostic similar to 450 Ma detrital zircons with large variation of cliff t) in the above strata were derived from arc igneous rocks associated with the evolution of Proto-Tethyan oceanalong the western margin of Simao block. This feature contrasts with the equivalent strata from Qiangtang and Tethyan Himalaya blocks, located along Gondwana Indian margin, which was dominated by similar to 0.95 Ga detrital zircons that derived from the orogenic belt within Gondwana. This difference indicates that the Simao block located outboard of the Indian margin of Gondwana before the opening of Paleo-Tethyan ocean. During the consumption of Paleo-Tethys, the I-type Xin'anzhai granitic intrusion emplaced at ca. 257 Ma. Geochemical compositions of the intrusion can be modeled by the partial melting of Proterozoic gneiss with an addition of 30-45% arc basaltic magma. Age histogram of detrital zircons from Upper Triassic sediments is featured by a peak of 254 Ma, similar to the emplacement age of the Xin'anzhai intrusion. This suggests an extensive magmatism occurred at ca. 255 Ma, which can be explained by the rollback of the Paleo-Tethyan slab. The subsequent granitoids emplaced in 247-237 Ma show different features of high-silica, peraluminous and a derivation from meta-sedimentary rocks, and were suggested to be produced in syn-collision setting. The Early Paleozoic strata in the eastern margin of Simao block generally show a NW-SE foliation and NE-SW striking stretching lineation, reflecting a NE-SW compression resulted from block amalgamation after the Paleo-Tethyan closure. In the angularly-unconformable overlying Upper Triassic strata, these structural traces are absent. It means that the area has evolved into post-collision extensional setting in Late Triassic.

The aim of this study is to decipher the provenance of the sedimentary units in the Lanping Basin and affiliation of Simao Terrane by the U-Pb ages, Hf isotope of detrital zircons and whole-rock geochemistry. The whole-rock geochemistry and the mineral composition indicate that most of the Triassic-Paleocene sedimentary rocks are derived from the upper crust and exhibit recycled orogen features. The detrital zircon U-Pb ages from the North Simao Terrane are consistent with the magmatic events during Early Neoproterozoic and Permian in the Western Yangtze Block. And the detrital zircons ages from North Simao Terrane show same distribution features as the Permian-Triassic magmatic rocks, which are distributed in the Simao Terrane and along major sutures. These comparisons suggest that the clastic sediments in Lanping Basin (North Simao Terrane) are derived from Early Neoproterozoic and Permian magmatic rocks from Western Yangtze Block, Permian-Triassic magmatic rocks from Simao Terrane, along Jinshajiang, Garz-Litang and Ailaoshan Sutures. The comparison of the detrital zircon age distributions shows that Simao Terrane and Yangtze Block exhibited similarity tectonic setting in the evolution history, especially during Paleoproterozoic-Late Paleozoic. This suggests that the Simao Terrane is part of Cathaysian old land, although Simao Terrane was separated from Yangtze Block for short period during Early Paleozoic. Besides, the Hf mapping, stratigraphic succession, paleogeography and paleomagnetism in SW China support that Simao Terrane has a Cathaysian old land-affinity, rather than one involving Gondwanaland.},

   abstract = {The Mianlue suture marks the southern boundary of the Qinling-Dabie orogen and divides the South China and North China continental blocks. Here we present in-situ U-Pb geochronology and Lu-Hf isotopic data on detrital zircons in chert beds intercalated with continental detritus from the Sanhekou Group in Wenxian along this suture. Our data suggest that deposition of these sediments in the Mianlue suture zone occurred later than ca. 412 Ma. The data define four main age peaks with more than 25% of the detrital zircons yielding ages between 801 and 999 Ma with epsilon Hf(t) ranging from -26.9 to 12.2. The age data are comparable with those zircons in the Neoproterozoic granites and volcanic rocks in the Bikou Block which has an affinity to the South China Block. Zircons with ages from 2310 to 2595 Ma comprise 14.1% of the detrital population, and were mainly sourced from the South China Block as inferred from their mostly negative epsilon Hf(t) values compared to the North China Block. Zircons with ages ranging from 412 to 587 Ma constitute 12.6% and show markedly negative epsilon Hf(t) values ranging from -0.6 to -25.5 (the majority ranging from -4.4 to -19.6), correlating with Palaeozoic magmatic intrusions in the South China Block. Another age peak of 1548-1686 Ma with epsilon Hf(t) values varying between -6.5 and -14.8 is comparable to the zircons in magmatic intrusions of the South China Block. Our results suggest that the major source of zircons in the continental detritus mixed with chert within the Mianlue suture zone is Proterozoic and Palaeozoic magmatic intrusions in the South China Block. Combined with the geochemical features of the chert in Wenxian and other outcrops in the Mianlue suture zone, we infer that these sediments were deposited in the Mianlue sea basin adjacent to the continental margin, and that the opening of the Mianlue suture was initiated in the eastern section of the northern margin of South China Block, with subsequent migration to the western part, in a zipper-type opening of the continental rift from the east to the west of the Mianlue suture zone.

   volume = {531},
   abstract = {The geometry and evolution of fluvial systems are thought to be related to surface uplift. In eastern Tibet, rivers exhibit peculiar drainage patterns but how these patterns were established and their connection with the plateau uplift are still under debate. Here, we use detrital zircon U-Pb dating, bedrock (U-Th)/He thermochronometry, topographic analysis and numerical modeling to explore the paleo-drainage pattern of the Dadu and Anning Rivers, eastern Tibet. Our detrital data indicate that the Pliocene sources of sediments to the Anning River are different from the modern ones and they include a source similar to that of the modern Dadu River, implying a paleo-connection between the Dadu and the Anning Rivers and a subsequent cutoff of this connection after the deposition of the Pliocene sediments. Bedrock thermochronometric data along the Dadu River reveal rapid cooling at similar to 10 Ma and a possible enhanced cooling at similar to 2 Ma, which we interpret as a response to the regional plateau uplift in eastern Tibet and to the Dadu-Anning capture, respectively. Combined with topographic analysis and numerical modeling, our results indicate an Early Pleistocene capture between the Dadu and Anning Rivers, resulting in the changes in the sediment sources of the Anning River, enhanced incision of the Dadu, and the transience of the Dadu River profile. The Dadu-Anning capture is related to the motion along the active sinistral strike-slip Daliangshan fault that locally disrupts the river network. This event does not date the plateau uplift; rather, it indicates how river reorganization can effectively enhance river incision and affect landscape development independently from regional-scale uplift.

   abstract = {The southern Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB) in South Mongolia consists of continental fragments sutured together by Paleozoic arc magmatism generated by the closing of the Paleo-Asian Ocean (PAO). Controversy persists regarding the timing and position of the final amalgamation of the Altai and Tianshan orogenic belts. This paper presents zircon U-Pb data of the Gurvan Sayhan accretionary complex, as well as the overlying sedimentary sequence, and a granite pluton intruding the complex to provide new insights into the Late Paleozoic evolution of South Mongolia. The detrital zircon grains from the Gurvan Sayhan accretionary complex yielded age spectra with predominant peaks at ca. 331 Ma, subdominant peaks at ca. 381, and 500 Ma, indistinct Precambrian peaks at ca. 848 Ma and the youngest group of 318 Ma. The Paleozoic zircon grains are interpreted to be derived from adjacent arc systems formed by the subduction of the PAO, whereas those with the Precambrian ages were possibly from the nearby Hangay and South Gobi microcontinent blocks. The proportion of Precambrian detrital zircon grains in the complex decreases with time, likely suggesting a change in the paleogeography during sedimentation of the complex. Detrital zircon grains from the overlying stratum produced an age spectrum characterized by containing the youngest peak at ca. 293 Ma, although older peaks at ca. 340 Ma and 466 Ma are also present. The granite pluton intruding the accretionary complex has an emplacement age of 292.9 +/- 1.3 Ma, similar with the youngest detrital zircon age peak from the overlying stratum, which is interpreted from the post-collisional magmatic rocks. Therefore, our results demonstrate that the final closure of the PAO in southern Mongolia was Late Carboniferous-Early Permian (318-293 Ma), and the Gurvan Sayhan accretionary complex represents the suture zone of the Altai and Tianshan orogenic belts.},

   abstract = {The terrestrial deposition process for karst bauxite is difficult to constrain due to its allochthonous origin, multiple controls and the difficulty in geodynamic reconstruction. This ambiguity has been clarified from investigation of the provenance and geologic-geographic conditions for the formation of Quaternary gibbsite nodules in the Yongjiang Basin. This karst basin, located at the southeastern propagation front of the Tibet Plateau, was affected by the SE Asia monsoon climate developed since the Late Oligocene and a later Quaternary glaciation. A thick blanket of Quaternary laterite is located on Paleozoic carbonate bedrock, and covers an area about 1000 km(2) along the east-flowing river systems in the basin. The laterite profiles are well layered, with a layer of iron-rich gibbsite nodules overlying on a basal clay zone and irregularly covered by a thin clayey topsoil. Gibbsite nodules from most localities yield detrital zircons with age peaks at ca. 1000 Ma, 450 Ma and 250 Ma, corresponding to those of the Mesozoic clastic and magmatic rocks exposed on the western and southern surrounding highlands; nevertheless, those from the Pingtianshan area produce an exclusive spike at ca. 100 Ma, consistent with the emplacement age of nearby granites. Apatite fission-track modeling for the Mesozoic clastic rocks and Darongshan granites shows a rapid cooling since the early Miocene, and that for the Pingtianshan Cretaceous granite reveals fast exhumation since the late Miocene. These data indicate differential erosion reshaped the topography and consequently a low-relief karst basin was developed, allowing a diverse material supply from the surrounding and local highlands via sheet flow and east-flowing rivers. Under a monsoon-influenced subtropical climate, aluminum and iron oxides/hydroxides were accumulated as nodules or concretions, which were cemented by and coated with Fe oxides due to variations in redox potential and alternating consolidation and swelling, while silica was leached. At greater depth, groundwater solutions preferentially removed and brought upward Fe under a reducing environment during the wet seasons, while an underlying clay layer occurred due to the reduced solubility of silica. Later, this bauxitization process was probably hindered by the Quaternary glaciation, which could have promoted the formation of the top clay layer. This terrestrial deposition process of Quaternary gibbsite nodules serves as one analogue for ancient karst bauxite, in which the following submergence would improve the quality via further precipitation of alumina hydroxide and leaching of extra Fe.

   abstract = {The tectonic evolution of the Tian Shan, as for most ranges in continental Asia is dominated by north-south compression since the Cenozoic India-Asia collision. However, precollision governing tectonic processes remain enigmatic. An excellent record is provided by thick Palaeozoic Cenozoic lacustrine to fluvial depositional sequences that are well preserved in the southern margin of the Junggar Basin and exposed along a foreland basin associated to the Late Cenozoic rejuvenation of the Tian Shan ranges. U/Pb (LA-ICP-MS) dating of detrital zircons from 14 sandstone samples from a continuous series ranging in age from latest Palaeozoic to Quaternary is used to investigate changes in sediment provenance through time and to correlate them with major tectonic phases in the range. Samples were systematically collected along two nearby sections in the foreland basin. The results show that the detrital zircons are mostly magmatic in origin, with some minor input from metamorphic zircons. The U-Pb detrital zircon ages range widely from 127 to 2856Ma and can be divided into four main groups: 127197 (sub-peak at 159Ma), 250379 (sub-peak at 318Ma), 381538 (sub-peak at 406Ma) and 5432856Ma (sub-peak at 912Ma). These groups indicate that the zircons were largely derived from the Tian Shan area to the south since a Late Carboniferous basin initiation. The provenance and basin-range pattern evolution of the southern margin of Junggar Basin can be generally divided into four stages: (1) Late Carboniferous Early Triassic basin evolution in a half-graben or post-orogenic extensional context; (2) From Middle Triassic to Upper Jurassic times, the southern Junggar became a passively subsiding basin until (3) being inverted during Lower Cretaceous Palaeogene; (4) During the Neogene, a piedmont developed along the northern margin of the North Tian Shan block and Junggar Basin became a true foreland basin.},

   abstract = {The Triassic Qinling Orogenic Belt was formed during the closure of the Paleo-Tethys Ocean, and its evolution can be traced by provenance analysis of sediments in the south of North China. We present detrital zircon ages, sandstone petrographic observations, paleocurrent data, and paleogeographic reconstructions that allow the evolution of this basin-mountain system to be reconstructed. Detrital zircons from upper Permian sedimentary rocks yield two major age peaks at 1876 and 259 Ma, and two minor age peaks at 2526 and 363 Ma. These zircons were likely sourced from recycled sediments in the Southern North China Block. Detrital zircons from Lower Triassic sedimentary rocks have multiple age peaks at ca. 2500, 1850, 950, 745, 450-430, and 310-250 Ma, reflecting a mixed provenance from the Qinling Orogenic Belt and Southern North China Block. Zircons from a Middle Triassic sandstone have a concentrated age peak at ca. 250 Ma and two subordinate age peaks at ca. 1800 and 2500 Ma. Hafnium isotope data for the late Paleozoic detrital zircons are characterized by negative epsilon Hf(t) values of -23.11 to -0.11, and only two grains have positive epsilon Hf(t) values of +1.45 and +2.10. We infer that these zircons were derived from recycled sediments in the Southern North China Block. The provenance data show that the North Qinling Belt and Southern North China Block had been uplifted prior to the Early Triassic. The uplift was mainly related to the continental collision between the South China and North China blocks. These and previously published data indicate the Southern North China Block experienced exhumation during the Middle-Late Triassic, firstly involving Permian cover rocks, followed by Cambrian and Neoproterozoic strata, and finally Mesoproterozoic basement rocks. The fold-and-thrust belt in the Southern North China Block probably formed during the Middle Triassic. Uplift and denudation of the Qinling Orogenic Belt controlled Triassic basin evolution in the south of North China. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {The mid-to late-Neoproterozoic magmatic rocks from the northern margin of the Yangtze Block are major protoliths of high-pressure (HP) and ultrahigh-pressure (UHP) metamorphic rocks in the Dabie-Sulu orogenic belt along the northern margin of the South China Block. Oxygen isotopic compositions of these mid-to late-Neoproterozoic magmatic rocks hold a key to understanding the origin of large-scale O-18-depletion in the HP and UHP metamorphic rocks. We report here the integrated in situ U-Pb dating and Hf-O isotope analyses of zircon grains from sedimentary and volcanic rocks in the Neoproterozoic Suixian Group along the northern margin of the Yangtze Block, South China. This study shows that the Suixian Group was deposited at 740-720 Ma, corresponding to late stage of the second deposition cycle (820-720 Ma) of the Neoproterozoic deposition in the Yangtze Block. Detrital zircon grains from the Suixian Group display age peaks at 0.73-0.74 Ga, 0.79 Ga, and 2.0 Ga. Zircon U-Pb ages together with Hf-O isotopic compositions indicate provenance of the Suixian Group dominantly from the proximal Neoproterozoic igneous rocks with possible contribution from Paleoproterozoic rocks along the northern margin of the South China Block. Zircon delta O-18 values from the Suixian Group have a large range from 10.5 parts per thousand to 13 parts per thousand. Zircon grains with negative delta O-18 values, typical index of magma-meteoric water interaction, were not identified in this study. The major phase of low-delta O-18 magmas (delta O-18(zircon) <4.6 parts per thousand) initiated at ca. 800 Ma, long before the first glaciation event arising at about 716 Ma in the South China Block, and lasted for over 100 m.y. The epsilon(Hf)(t) values of the low-delta O-18 zircon grains from the Suixian Group range between -15.5 and 10.7. About 74 percent of low-delta O-18 zircon grains have negative epsilon(Hf)(t) values varying from-15.5 to 0. This strongly argues against the possibility that the low-delta O-18 magma was generated dominantly by partial melting of high-T hydrothermally altered oceanic lower crust. This study emphasizes that high-T water-rock interaction and continental rifting tectonic setting are essential to produce the abundant low-delta O-18 magmas, and confirms that most of negative delta O-18 signature identified in zircon grains from HP and UHP metamorphic rocks may not have been inherited from their Neoproterozoic protoliths.

   abstract = {Suizhou-Zaoyang area is located in the southern Qinling-Tongbai-Dabie Orogen, China. A combined research on U-Pb ages and Lu-Hf isotopes for detrital zircons from three meta-sedimentary rocks in the Wudang Group is reported. The upper Wudang Group has a major age population of ca. 750 Ma and a sub-major of ca. 860 Ma. But the lower part only yields one age peak at ca. 2.03 Ga. In situ Lu-Hf analyses of the young age group of ca. 750 Ma for zircons from the upper Wudang Group yield an average E > (Hf)(t) value of -8.6 and two-stage Hf model ages (T (DM2)) from 1837 to 2230 Ma, respectively. However, zircons from the lower Group give an average E > (Hf)(t) value of 4.5 and T (DM1) of 2220 +/- 22 Ma, close to the timing of zircon crystallization. Thus, it is suggested that, in the study area, the continental crust grew during the middle Paleoproterozoic and reworked during the middle Neoproterozoic, which shows the affinity to the Dabie Orogen. In addition, in the lower Wudang Group, two metamorphic zircon ages of 1992 +/- 91 Ma and 1999 +/- 61 Ma are consistent with that of the middle Paleoproterozoic metamorphism event in the northern Yangtze Block, which may represent the assemblage of the Columbia Supercontinent. On the basis of the U-Pb ages and Hf isotopes, it is proposed that Suizhou-Zaoyang area was involved in the subduction-collision event in the middle Paleoproterozoic and the Yangtze Block was one of the components of the Paleo-Mesoproterozoic supercontinent.},

   abstract = {The Yangtze Block is separated into the eastern Yangtze Block (EYB) and western Yangtze Block (WYB) by the Chongqing-Huaying line (CHL). An integrated study of detrital zircon Lu-Hf isotopes and U-Pb ages from two sandstones in the Huashan Group together with previous studies reveals six major tectonothermal events in the EYB occurring at about 2.87 Ga, 2.67 Ga, 2.5 Ga, 2.0 Ga, 1.84 Ga and 0.8 Ga. Combined with paleogeographic map, this study reveals distinct detrital zircon U-Pb ages and Hf isotopic characteristics in the western EYB and eastern EYB. The former has most zircon U-Pb ages grouped at about 2.0 Ga, 2.67 Ga and 2.87 Ga with sporadic 2.5 Ga ages. The similar to 2.5 Ga zircons show negative to slightly positive epsilon(Hf)(t) values. However, the latter has significant ages grouped at similar to 2.0 Ga and similar to 2.5 Ga with negligible 2.67 Ga and older zircon ages. The similar to 2.5 Ga zircons show negative to high positive epsilon(Hf)(t) values. The Early Neoarchean (2.7-2.6 Ga) was a significant period for production of mature continental crust in the western EYB and the majority of crustal materials were extracted from the depleted mantle until then. Zircon Hf isotopic compositions indicate that the Late Neoarchean to Early Paleoproterozoic event (similar to 2.5 Ga) involved both reworking of old crust and juvenile crust growth. With previous studies of sedimentary facies, lithochemical compositions, zircon morphology and zircon Hf isotopes, it is proposed that there are unexposed similar to 2.5 Ga basement rocks in the EYB. During the 2.2-1.8 Ga, subduction processes, collisional and post-collisional events were recorded in the north and west of the EYB, which can be correlated to the assembly and breakup of the supercontinent Columbia. Two changes in epsilon(Hf)(t) value at similar to 840 Ma and similar to 790 Ma have been found from detrital zircons in the northern margin of the EYB, which probably represent arc-continent collision and continent-continent collision events, respectively. This long-term subduction process occurring at 1100-790 Ma in the EYB appeals for a peripheral position for the Yangtze Block in the supercontinent Rodinia. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

   abstract = {The Cathaysia Block of the South China Craton includes a Proterozoic basement that experienced a prolonged Precambrian crustal evolution but to date lacks evidence of Proterozoic metamorphic ages. At Lichuan and Jianning, in the Wuyi Domain of the eastern Cathaysia Block, Proterozoic rock units include migmatized paragneiss of the Wanyuan Group and minor amphibolite of the Tianjingping Formation, which are enveloped by schist of Mayuan Group, and all are intruded by Paleozoic and Mesozoic igneous rocks. Detrital zircon grains from the Wanyuan paragneiss display metamorphic rims that yield concordant weighted average Pb-206/U-238 ages of 860 +/- 6 Ma and 435 +/- 5 Ma, along with variably disconcordant ages with lower intercept ages of 442 +/- 41 Ma. The zircon core ages range from 3015 Ma to 851 Ma, with three major age populations at 930-865 Ma, 1850-1200 Ma and 2650-2400 Ma. Detrital zircon grains from Mayuan schist samples at Jianning generally lack core-rim structures and yield three main age populations at 860-736 Ma, 1835-1775 Ma and 2720-2500 Ma. Metamorphic ages of ca. 860 Ma and ca. 435 Ma for the Wanyuan paragneiss along with the youngest detrital zircon constrain the depositional age of the protolith to ca. 865-860 Ma, whereas the Mayuan Group is younger and probably deposited after ca. 736 Ma. Characteristics of detrital zircon age populations along with regional geological data suggest accumulation of the Wanyuan Group in a convergent and/or collisional setting. Metamorphism and a possible subduction-collision process within the Cathaysia Block at around 860 Ma suggest it was not a unified block in early Neoproterozoic. The growth of ca. 440 Ma metamorphic rims is likely related to granitic magmatism, such as that exposed in the Lichuan region. The sparse evidence for early Neoproterozoic metamorphism likely reflects widespread overprinting by the Paleozoic tectonothermal event at around 440 Ma. (C)2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {This paper reports some new results from U-Pb geochronological, Hf isotopic and REE geochemical studies of detrital zircons in the Ordovician sandstones from South Jiangxi within Cathaysia. 426 groups of U-Pb age determinations define five major age populations: 2560-2380 Ma (a peak of 2460 Ma), 1930-1520 Ma (a peak of 1700 Ma), 1300-900 Ma (a major peak at 970 Ma and two subordinate peaks at 1250 Ma and 1130 Ma), 850-730 Ma (a prominent peak of 780 Ma) and 670-530 Ma (a major peak at 540 Ma and a subordinate peak at 650 Ma). We also report zircon U-Pb concordia age of 3.96 Ga, which is the oldest age so far obtained from Cathaysia. The age peak at 2460 Ma correlates with similar ages reported for Neoarchean global continental growth. The 1930-1520 Ma population broadly overlaps with the time of amalgamation and disruption of the Columbia supercontinent. The major age peak at 970 Ma and two secondary peaks at 1250 Ma and 1130 Ma reflect multiple tectonothermal events associated with the assembly of Rodinia. Similar ages are widely reported from the South China Craton (SCC). Our study reveals that the 850-730 Ma population is consistent with the breakup period of Rodinia, suggesting that the SCC within Rodinia began to break up since 850 Ma. Geologically, the evidence for this breakup event is widespread and presented by Neoproterozoic granites, bimodal igneous rocks, basic dyke swarms and formation of continental rift type basins. Our study also reveals a 670-530 Ma population that correlates well with the assembly of Gondwana during end Neoproterozoic. However, direct geological evidence for this event has not yet been found within the studied area. Furthermore, the Hf isotopic model age data suggest two major stages of crustal evolution within Cathaysia. The first is the event dated at 1.6-2.8 Ga and the second one at 3.5-3.9 Ga. The zircons show a large range of epsilon Hf(t) values from +8.64 to -30.54, suggesting that they have different origins with a similar age of crystallization. The fact that most detrital zircons show negative epsilon Hf(t) values suggests the ancient provenances of Cathaysia were dominated by reworked crustal materials.

   abstract = {The unified South China Block, comprising the Yangtze Block to the northwest and the Cathaysia Block to the southeast, has been central to recent studies on the Precambrian crustal evolution and position of South China in Proterozoic supercontinents. Here we present results from detailed U-Pb geochronology, Lu-Hf isotopes and rare earth geochemistry on zircons from three Ordovician and Devonian sandstone samples of southeastern Yangtze, together with those from a granodiorite sample and three Triassic sandstone samples in northeast and southeast Cathaysia. The southeastern Yangtze Block is characterized by extensive tectono-thermal events during 850-730 Ma and 470-410 Ma, which corresponded to the breakup of Rodinia and the Caledonian orogenic event, respectively. Major zircon populations with ages of 2800-2500 Ma, 1990-1580 Ma and 1260-920 Ma are recorded from southeastern Yangtze, which are correlated, respectively, with the Neoarchean crustal growth, and histories of the Paleo-Mesoproterozoic Columbia and Neoproterozoic Rodinia supercontinents. In contrast, zircon U-Pb ages from southeast Cathaysia reveal prominent magmatic events during 2630-2300 Ma, 2030-1770 Ma and 280-190 Ma, correlated with Neoarchean continental growth and the tectonothermal regimes associated with the history of the Columbia supercontinent as well as the Indosinian movement. The sector-zoned zircons from the granodiorite in northeast Cathaysia yielded weighted mean ages of 846.7 +/- 9.8 Ma and 826.4 +/- 7.6 Ma and positive epsilon Hf values, constraining the initial breakup of South China at ca. 848 Ma and extensive rift-related magmatism at ca. 826 Ma. The Hf data suggest important episodes of juvenile magmatic addition at 3.1-2.8 Ga and 2.4-1.5 Ga for Yangtze, and at 3.3-2.3 Ga for Cathaysia, indicating the existence of older crustal components in South China. The Hf data suggest that most zircons in both the blocks were derived from crustal magmas. Our results suggest distinct crustal evolution histories for the Yangtze and Cathaysia Blocks albeit with close affinities. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {The Jiangnan Orogen, the eastern part of which comprises the oceanic Huaiyu terrane to the northeast and the continental Jiuling terrane to the southwest, marks the collision zone of the Yangtze and the Cathaysia Blocks in South China. Here, zircon U-Pb geochronological and Lu-Hf isotopic results from typical basement and cover meta-sedimentary/sedimentary rock units in the eastern Jiangnan Orogen are presented. The basement sequences in southwestern Huaiyu terrane are mainly composed of marine volcaniclastic turbidite, ophiolite suite and tuffaceous phyllite, whereas those in the northeastern Huaiyu consist of littoral face pebbly feldspathic sandstones and greywacke interbedded with intermediate-basic volcanic rocks. Combined with previous studies, the present data show that the basement sequences exhibit arc affinities. Zircons from the basement phyllite in the southwestern margin of the Huaiyu terrane, representing a Neoproterozoic back-arc basin, yield a single age population of 800-900 Ma. The basement greywacke from northeastern Huaiyu terrane, representing fore-arc basin, is also characterized by zircons that preserve a single tectono-thermal event during 800-940 Ma. However, the late Neoproterozoic cover sequence preserves zircons from multiple sources with age populations of 750-890 Ma, 1670-2070 Ma and 2385-2550 Ma. Moreover, Hf isotopic data further reveal that most detrital zircons from the basement sequences yield positive epsilon Hf(t) values and late Mesoproterozoic model ages, while those of the cover sequence mostly show negative epsilon Hf(t) values. The Hf isotopic data therefore suggest that the basement sequences are soured from a Neoproterozoic arc produced by reworking of subducted late Mesoproterozoic materials. The geochronological and Hf isotopic data presented in this study suggest ca. 800 Ma for the assembly of the Huaiyu and Jiuling terranes, implying that the amalgamation of the Yangtze and Cathaysia Blocks in the eastern part occurred at ca. 800 Ma.

   abstract = {The Jiangnan orogenic belt in South China defines a subduction-collisional zone between the Yangtze and the Cathaysia blocks. The eastern part of this belt comprises the oceanic Huaiyu terrane, the northeast Jiangxi suture zone and the continental Jiuling terrane. We report zircon U-Pb and Hf isotope data and whole rock geochemistry on the arc magmatic rocks of andesite and basalt occurring as olistostromal blocks, as well as conglomerate in the Dengshan Group above the unconformity between cover sequence and the volcanic arc units. The andesites yield weighted mean ages of 864 Ma, 868 and 871 Ma, whereas the detrital zircons from the conglomerate yield a major age population of 863-810 Ma (peak of 833 Ma), with two minor ones of 1120-940 Ma (peak at 960 Ma) and 1780-1560 Ma (1670 Ma). A post-ca. 810 Ma depositional age is thus suggested for the Dengshan Group. The influx of olistostromal deposits into the Dengshan Group must post-date the youngest detrital zircon age of 810 Ma and is possibly related to the widespread Nanhua rifting associated with the breakup of Rodinia. Furthermore, the age distribution of detrital zircons from the phyllite associated with the arc units compared to its depositional age also suggest a convergent setting, and those from the conglomerate are plotted into a similar field. The andesite and basaltic trachyandesite have LREE enriched patterns, with minor negative Eu anomaly, and negative Nb, Ta, Cs and Ti anomalies. However, the basalt displays only minor LREE enrichment, with no Eu anomaly, and almost flat spidergram trace element patterns, except for a minor positive Sr, Ba and Ti anomaly and negative Rb anomaly. The andesite and basaltic trachyandesite are all plotted in the field of volcanic arc, suggesting an arc setting. The basalt is plotted between EMROB and volcanic arc domains, suggesting magma generation from metasomatised sub-arc sources with subducted oceanic components. The Hf isotopic data on zircons from the andesite yield positive epsilon Hf(t) values of 2.79-15.51 and late Mesoproterozoic model ages, suggesting that the Neoproterozoic arc sources include reworking of subducted late Mesoproterozoic materials. Our results show that the amalgamation of the Yangtze and Cathaysia blocks in the eastern part occurred at some time between ca. 864 Ma and ca. 810 Ma. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The orogen is divisible into three units: a northeastern domain (also referred to as the Huaiyu or Shuangxiwu domain), a central domain (Jiuling domain) and an undifferentiated southwestern domain. Detrital zircons from the oldest sequences (Shuangqiaoshan, Lengjiaxi, Fanjingshan and Sibao groups) in the central and southwest domains yield similar age spectra with major age populations at c. 875-820 Ma, along with minor Palaeo- to Mesoproterozoic and Archaean ages. The dominance of detrital ages close to the deposition ages of the units, along with juvenile zircon Hf isotopic compositions and arc-like whole-rock compositional data, indicate the sedimentary units accumulated adjacent to a convergent plate margin magmatic arc. The presence of Mesoproterozoic and older zircons, both as detritus in the units and as xenocrysts within igneous rocks displaying a subduction-related signature, along with the compositional data, place the magmatic arc along a continental margin. In the northeastern domain, the oldest coeval sequence (Shuangxiwu and Qigong groups) and arc igneous suites are dated at c. 970-850 Ma, and lack older detritus and xenocrysts, indicating they represent an accreted oceanic arc system.},

The Shuangming and Xinqiao sections are interpreted to represent the remnant Nanhua foreland basin, whereas the Jiangshan section is in the fold-and-thrust zone of the Wuyi-Yunkai orogen. The Lizhu-Changshan thrust fault in between is interpreted to be the frontal thrust and the boundary of the orogen. Detrital provenance analysis of the Ordovician-Devonian sandstones from the Shuangming and Xinqiao sections shows that the Ordovician-Silurian, mid- to late-orogenic sandstones contain dominantly 860-780 Ma zircon populations and subordinate 2.5 Ga, 1.89-1.78 Ga, 980-950 Ma, 630-540 Ma and 430 Ma populations, indicating nearby sources including the early Neoproterozoic Sibao orogen, inverted Neoproterozoic rift basins and related plutons, recycled Ediacaran-Cambrian strata and, increasing with time, exposed Cathaysia basement and minor syn- to late-orogenic plutonic intrusions. The Devonian post-orogenic sandstones exhibit a dominant 440 Ma population with minor 2.5 Ga, 1.89-1.78 Ga, 860-780 Ma and 630-540 Ma populations, suggesting a dominant contribution from now widely exposed, mid- to late-orogenic plutonic intrusions (with or without contributions from rare volcanism of similar ages) in a residual topographic high SE of the Lizhu-Changshan fault. This residual topographic high of the Wuyi-Yunkai orogen had completely perished by early Carboniferous time, c. 60 Myr after the end of the orogenic event.},

   abstract = {Hainan Island in southwestern south China has 1.43 Ga crystalline rocks as part of the Proterozoic basement rocks for the Cathaysia Block. Understanding Proterozoic tectonics of the island is thus essential for constraining the paleogeographic positions of the Cathaysia Block in Precambrian supercontinents. We report here new geochronological and Hf-O isotopic results for Mesoproterozoic gneisses, metavolcanic and metasedimentary rocks, and quartz sandstones from Hainan Island. Together with published data from the region, we divide Hainan Mesoproterozoic rocks into three major tectonostratigraphic units: (1) the amphibolite-facies Baoban Complex, consisting mainly of 1.43 Ga volcanic/plutonic rocks and sedimentary rocks formed in a continental rift setting but subsequently experienced high-grade metamorphism during 1.3-1.0 Ga; (2) the greenschist-facies Shilu Group, consisting of 1.43 Ga rift sediments with 1.44 Ga tuff in the "fifth layer" that are coeval with the protolith of the Baoban Complex, and ca. 1.0 Ga foreland basin sediments in the "sixth layer", all underwent upper greenschist-facies metamorphism soon after the deposition of the "sixth layer"; (3) the Shihuiding Formation that unconformably overlies the Shilu Group, consisting of <1.1 Ga (most likely (<= 1.0 Ga) coastal marine to lagoon sediments deposited in a post-orogenic setting. Inter-continental provenance and magmatic comparisons suggest a united Tasmania-Cathaysia-Laurentia landmass during the Mesoproterozoic, likely all received similar sourced rifting sediments from Cathaysia-like basements during the Nuna breakup at similar to 1.43 Ga. The 1.3(?)-0.9 Ga Grenville-aged Sibao orogeny welded the Yangtze Block with the Cathaysia-Laurentia landmass, bringing Tasmania, Yangtze and the Cathaysia-Laurentia landmass together. Sedimentary detritus were shed from the orogen to basins covering Hainan Island, western Yangtze, Tasmania and western Laurentia during the assembling of Rodinia. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

   abstract = {We report here in-situ U-Pb and Hf isotopic results of detrital zircons from sixteen Cambrian-Silurian siliciclastic samples across the Nanhua foreland basin, South China. Together with published data from Ediacaran-Silurian sandstones in the region, we establish the temporal and spatial provenance evolution across the basin. Except for samples from northeast Yangtze, all other Ediacaran-Silurian samples exhibit a prominent population of 1100-900 Ma, moderate populations of 850-700 Ma and 650-490 Ma, and minor populations of 2500 Ma and 2000-1300 Ma, grossly matching that of crystalline and sedimentary rocks in northern India. Zircon Hf isotopes further reveal four episodes of juvenile crustal growth at 2.5 Ga, 1.8 Ga, 1.4 Ga and 1.0 Ga in the source regions. Utilizing the basin history and late Neoproterozoic to early Paleozoic paleogeography of South China, we conclude that the Ediacaran-Cambrian sediments in the Nanhua foreland basin were mainly sourced from northern India and adjacent orogens, and the Ordovician-Silurian sediments were derived from both locally recycled Ediacaran-Cambrian rocks and eroded Cathaysian basement. The Wuyi-Yunkai late-orogenic magmatic rocks also contributed to the Silurian sediments in the basin. The upper-Ordovician to Silurian samples in northeast Yangtze received higher proportions of local Cryogenian (850-700 Ma) magmatic rocks which were uplifted during late-Ordovician to Silurian time. We speculate that there was an Ediacaran-Cambrian collisional orogen between South China and northern India, shedding sediments to the early Nanhua foreland basin. Far-field stress during the late stage of this collisional orogeny triggered the Ordovician-Silurian intraplate Wuyi-Yunkai orogeny in South China, and erosion of the local Wuyi-Yunkai orogen further provided detritus to the late Nanhua foreland basin.

Zircons from the Cambrian sandstones exhibit a dominant similar to 800 Ma age peak in the central Yangtze Block, being sourced from the western Yangtze Block, whereas a similar to 980 Ma peak dominates in the northwestern Cathaysia Block, being sourced from an exotic continent once connected to Cathaysia. A mixed provenance with both age peaks is found in Cambrian sandstones from the southeastern Yangtze Block, indicating that detritus can travel from the Cathaysia Block to the Yangtze Block, and therefore arguing against the existence of a broad Cambrian ocean.},

   abstract = {This study examines the original nature, tectonic setting, and evolution of Paleoproterozoic metasedimentary rocks in the Laoling Group of northern Jiao-Liao-Ji Belt (JLJB), in the northeastern margin of the Eastern Block of the North China Craton (NCC), using new petrological, whole-rock geochemical, geochronological, and Lu-Hf isotope data. The youngest detrital zircons constrain the maximum deposition age of the metasedimentary rocks to 1.97 Ga, and two metamorphic zircon age peaks correspond to 1.91 and 1.84 Ga for their metamorphism. The protoliths of the metasedimentary rocks in the Laoling Group were medium- to fine-grained clastic sediments, dominated by shale, graywacke, and claystone, with a smaller amount of sandstone, derived from Paleoproterozoic granites and coeval acidic meta-volcanic rocks, with minor contributions from Mesoarchean-Neoarchean basement rocks and Paleoproterozoic meta-mafic rocks. The protoliths of the metasedimentary rocks in the Dalizi Formation of the Laoling Group were deposited in a convergent margin setting, and subduction along the northern JLJB likely ended before ca. 1.91 Ga when the Longgang and Nangrim blocks collided. The epsilon(Hf)(t) values of ca. 2.14 Ga zircons mostly lie between the depletion mantle and the chondrite evolution line, coupled with extensive coeval magmatism, are consistent with the ca. 2.14 Ga significant continental crust growth in this region. An integrated study of petrology, geochemistry, metamorphic P-T paths, and tectonic evolution suggests that the JLJB experienced two metamorphic events at ca. 1.91 and 1.84 Ga.},

   abstract = {The Jiangnan Orogenic Belt is a NE-SW trending fold belt in the southeastern Yangtze Block of South China. The eastern segment of the belt, located in northeastern Jiangxi and southern Anhui provinces, is predominated by greenschist-facies metamorphosed volcanic-sedimentary strata with minor ophiolite, and their protoliths are considered to have formed in a back-arc basin. Zircon SHRIMP U-Pb dating reveals that these rocks were deposited/emplaced in the period 842-825 Ma. Zircon LA-ICP-MS Hf analyses show that most igneous zircons from the volcanic-sedimentary rocks possess positive epsilon(Hf)(t) values of 0.09-12.74, corresponding to depleted-source model ages of 0.9-1.4 Ga. This suggests a significant Neoproterozoic juvenile crustal growth event in the southeastern part of the Yangtze Block, which is also documented by gabbro (833 Ma) from ophiolite with positive epsilon(Hf)(t) values of 5.24-13.25 and hafnium model ages of 0.87-1.20 Ga. These new data, combined with previous results, indicate the presence of an arc and back-arc basin system along the southeastern margin of the Yangtze Block at 842-825 Ma. Collision of the arc with the proposed Shuangxiwu Composite Terrane, which had previously formed away from the southeastern margin of the Yangtze Block through possible subduction and collision, led to the closure of the back-arc basin and the formation of the Jiangnan Belt in the period 825-815 Ma. We suggest that South China is an accretionary orogen and that orogen-parallel motion along terrane-bounding shear zones may have played a significant role in its amalgamation. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

   abstract = {Understanding the tectonic nature of the Alxa area is significant in tectonic reconstruction of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt, but their tectonic correlation, affinity, and implications have not been well defined. The late Palaeozoic sediments in the northern Alxa area can help to understand this question. The sedimentary sequence of the late Palaeozoic strata (Benbatu Formation) indicates that the sedimentary environment of the study area gradually changed from a stable carbonate platform to a bathyal-abyssal environment with relatively active tectonic setting. The results of the grain size analysis of the sandstone debris show the typical characteristics of a turbidity current. The composition of clastic particles is mainly feldspar, which is characterized by short transport distance and rapid deposition of sediments. Combined with the geochemical characteristics of sandstone, the northern Alxa Block is considered to be an active continental margin in the late Palaeozoic. Through summarizing the zircon data of the Alxa Block, Tarim Craton, and North China Craton, it is concluded that the Palaeozoic clastic zircons in the study area come from the Alxa Block and the surrounding magmatic arc, the Neoproterozoic-Middle Proterozoic zircons come from the Alxa Block, the Archean zircons come from the North China Craton. According to the age distribution of clastic zircons, the magmatic activity may exist in the early Palaeozoic, which suggests it may not be a stable passive continental margin in the margin of northern Alxa Block in the early Palaeozoic. Based on the provenance analyses, the sources block shows no tectonic affinity to the Tarim Craton, but the Hanwula area in the north of the study area might have been accreted to the Tarim Craton, which means the size of the Paleo-Asian Ocean between the study area and the Hangwula area is large. The earliest Palaeozoic clastic zircon ages in sedimentary rocks are recorded in the late Cambrian, whereas the earliest Palaeozoic detrital zircons in the Hangwula area are recorded in the Ordovician, which means that the magmatic activity recorded in the study area is earlier than the Hangwula area and indicates that the subduction of the south side of the Paleo-Asian Ocean began earlier than the north side. The evidence of magmatic rocks discovered so far confirms this view.},

   abstract = {Using provenance analysis to build an accurate source-to-sink relationship is the key to infer mountain building scenarios around the Qaidam Basin, and also important to understanding the uplift and expansion of the Tibetan Plateau. However, some conflicting provenance inferences are caused by different interpretations for the prevalent existence of the late Paleozoic to early Mesozoic age group in detrital zircon U-Pb age spectra of the Paleogene strata at the northern Qaidam Basin, and these need to be resolved. In this article, an integrated study of sediment distribution, heavy mineral assemblages, and detrital zircon U-Pb geochronology is carried out to analyze provenance of the Paleogene strata at the northern Qaidam Basin. The decreasing trends of the net sand to gross thickness ratios and conglomerate percentages away from the Qilian Mountains and Altyn Tagh range to basin interior clearly support they are the provenance areas. Sedimentation of materials from the Altyn Tagh range is spatially confined to a small area in front of the mountains. A large sandy body with a uniform distribution of detrital zircon ages (containing a lot of the late Paleozoic to early Mesozoic zircon ages) and heavy mineral assemblages in the Xiaganchaigou Formation is supplied by the Qilian Mountains.},

   abstract = {The exposed metamorphic rocks and xenolithic metamorphic rocks in the Xiangshan-Yuhuashan (XSYHS) area in central Jiangxi Province, South China, were studied in order to reveal the compositions of the basement rocks and their tectonic implications. Bulk geochemistry and zircon U-Pb-Hf isotopic compositions suggest that the basement metamorphic rocks in the XSYHS area are mainly composed of Neoproterozoic (after 822-683 Ma) meta-sedimentary rocks. The exposed meta-sedimentary rocks show higher K2O/Na2O and Al2O3/(Na2O + CaO) and lower Eu/Eu* than those occurring as xenoliths in the Yuhuashan volcanic-intrusive complex, indicating relatively strong weathering and leaching in the provenance area. Geochemical data suggest that the detritus of the exposed metasedimentary rocks was derived mainly from felsic to intermediate igneous rocks, similar to Neoproterozoic sedimentary rocks in the southern Yangtze Block, whereas the xenolithic metasedimentary rocks contain more recycled material, similar to those in the Cathaysia Block. These xenoliths from the mid-lower crust also have significantly high U contents. Consequently they probably are an important source for uranium in the XSYHS volcanic rocks. U-Pb ages of detrital zircons show that the protoliths of the xenoliths are mainly composed of Neoproterozoic, Neoarchean and Paleoproterozoic detritus, similar to the components of the Wuyi terrane in the eastern Cathaysia Block. In contrast, the protoliths of the exposed metasedimentary rocks consist mainly of Neoproterozoic detritus with minor Neoarchean and Paleoproterozoic fragments, similar to those in the southern Yangtze Block. Both geochemistry and zircon U-Pb-Hf isotope compositions suggest that the deep basement metamorphic rocks in the XSYHS area belong to the Wuyi terrane, whereas the surface metamorphic rocks are derived from the southern Yangtze Block. Therefore, the real boundary between the Yangtze and Cathaysia blocks lies north of the study area. The exposed Yangtze-related metamorphic rocks were overthrust southward from the southern Yangtze Block, and onto the Cathaysia basement, during the lndosinian to Yanshanian Orogeny.

   abstract = {The oldest rocks of the Cathaysia Block, South China, comprise the Badu Complex and Paleoproterozoic granites in the Wuyishan area (southern Zhejiang and northwestern Fujian Provinces). New zircon U-Pb ages, Hf isotopes and trace elements for metamorphic rocks from the Badu Complex, and bulk Nd-isotope compositions of these rocks and granites in the Wuyishan area provide important constraints on the Precambrian crustal evolution of the Cathaysia Block. Inherited cores of zircon grains from the metamorphic rocks are of magmatic origin, predominantly formed at ca 2.5 Ga, while overgrowth rims reflect two episodes of granulite-facies metamorphism related to collisional orogeny at 1.89-1.88 Ga and 252-234 Ma. The unimodal age distribution (similar to 2.5 Ga) of detrital zircons and the positive epsilon Hf(t) of most Neoarchean zircons suggest that the detritus of these sedimentary protoliths of the Badu Complex came from a proximal volcanic arc, and that they were deposited in an arc basin synchronously with similar to 2.5 Ga volcanism. Zircon U-Pb ages and Hf-isotopes with whole-rock Nd isotopes suggest that the juvenile crust of the eastern Cathaysia Block was generated mainly at 2.5 Ga and 2.8 Ga, and minor at 3.5-3.3 Ga with some evidence for the generation at 3.7-3.6 Ga and similar to 4.0 Ga. A strong similar to 1.9 Ga orogeny and the 3.3-3.0 Ga thermal event only involved the reworking of older crust material. Paleoproterozoic (1.89-1.86 Ga) granitic magmatic activity and high-grade metamorphism in the eastern Cathaysia Block were synchronous with the assembly of the Columbia supercontinent. Using integrated geochronological, Hf-Nd isotopic and petrologic data as a "barcode", we compare the Cathaysia Block with other Paleoproterozoic orogens worldwide, and argue that its closest affinity is with the South Korean Peninsula and the Lesser Himalaya of NW India. Consequently, the eastern Cathaysia block, and the South Korean massif (as the united Cathay-South Korea terrane) was close to the Lesser Himalaya terrane in the Paleoproterozoic configuration of the Columbia supercontinent. The spatial linkage was maintained for ca 1 Ga, until the fragmentation of the Rodinia supercontinent during Neoproterozoic time. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Zircon ages exhibit two major clusters at similar to 250 and similar to 2400 Ma whereas two minor clusters at similar to 450 and similar to 850 Ma, suggesting primary sources from the East Kunlun Shan and Oulongbuluke Block, secondary sources from the North Qaidam UHP belt and South Qilian Shan. Combined with observation of lithology and sedimentary facies, two rifting periods were inferred in the earliest Jurassic and the early stage of the Middle Jurassic, respectively, accompanied by further extension throughout the Jurassic. Our results do not support a foreland basin related to the Jurassic southward thrusting of the South Qilian Shan, but favor that the Mesozoic intra-continental tectonics in West China were characterised by pulsed responses to specific collisions rather than a persisting contractional setting during Jurassic period.},

   journal = {Ore Geology Reviews},
   volume = {127},
   abstract = {The Jiangnan Orogen separates the Yangtze block from the Cathaysia block to the southeast. Several competing models have been proposed for the evolution of both blocks and the intervening orogen, which mainly focus on aspects of igneous and metamorphic rocks. Limited research has been conducted on the sedimentary rocks in this region. Provenance of the Late Ordovician sedimentary rocks in the northeastern Jiangnan Orogen has been constrained based on systemic analyses of petrology, heavy mineral assemblages, geochemistry, and detrital zircon U-Pb ages, which provide vital clues for reconstructing the evolution of this belt during the early Paleozoic. Late Ordovician deposits in the northeastern Jiangnan Orogen consist of conglomerates, sandstones, siltstones, shales, calcareous mudstones, and limestones. These strata were deposited in a shallow to deep sea environment, showing water depth deepening to the northwest. The sandstone contains lithic graywackes and feldspar-lithic graywackes, with low compositional and textural maturities. They consist, on average, of quartz clasts (27%), feldspar clasts (18%), and lithic fragments (55%). The lithic fragments are angular, including andesites, rhyolites, tuffs, granites, slates, phyllites, quartzites, siltstones, and chert, which also occur in conglomerate form. Minor pyroxene, chromite, magnetite, and garnet grains occur in the sandstone. Geochemical analyses show that the sandstone and siltstone have widely variable Fe2O3T + MgO (4.43-12.05%), Cs, V, Ni, and Ti contents. They also exhibit a distinct negative Nb-Ta trough compared to the average upper continental crust and have light rare earth element (LREE) enrichment patterns with obvious Eu anomalies, similar to subduction-related rocks in an arc setting. Detrital zircon U-Pb ages demonstrate a mixed source from ca. 784 Ma and ca. 455 Ma. Paleocurrent indicators point to a southeastward origin. These results demonstrate that Late Ordovician sedimentary deposition occurred in a northwestward-facing active continental margin along the southeastern Yangtze block.},

U-Pb detrital Zircon age patterns from Middle Ordovician to Lower Silurian sandstones around the Jiangnan Uplift within the basin provide evidence for exhumation and erosion of the basin basement The majority of the samples from both east and west of the Jiangnan Uplift display similar age distributions with a dominant peak between 1000 and 900 Ma and subordinate peaks at similar to 2500 Ma, similar to 1700 Ma and 600-500 Ma. However, the zircon age spectrum of one sample from the west side of the Uplift is distinct with a main peak at 880 Ma and lacking grains younger than 650 Ma. Combined geochronological and paleocurrent data suggest that detritus within the syn-orogenic basins was derived from the northern segment of East Gondwana but with additional input of detritus from the Jiangnan Uplift by the late Early Silurian. This information together with analysis of time equivalent strata along strike to the northeast suggests that the Jiangnan Uplift was not a continuous barrier to sediment transport from the southeast but represented part of a discontinuous series of islands supplying local detritus that was mixed with sediment transported from northern Gondwana.

   abstract = {The Paleocene Shashi Formation, the host formation of potassium-rich brines and solid potash in the Jianghan Basin, central China, is characterized by rift sediments in a composite basin-mountain system. However, the provenance of the Paleocene Jianghan Basin remains poorly understood. A combined study of petrographic examination, geochemical analysis, and zircon U-Pb dating was conducted to characterize the provenance of the Shashi Formation. The petrographic analysis of the Shashi Formation reveals that these samples have predominantly quartz-lithic compositions with minor contributions from other minerals. Whole-rock geochemical data indicate that this formation experienced only slight to moderate alteration. The chondrite-normalized rare earth element (REE) patterns of these samples are essentially parallel to those of the upper continental crust (UCC), as their negative Eu-anomalies and Th/Sc and La/Th ratios suggest an average source composition similar to that of the UCC. These values, together with plots of their Th/U vs. Th ratios, suggest that certain samples have undergone moderate degrees of weathering and sedimentary recycling. The analysis of major and trace elements (i.e., La/Th-Hf, Th/Sc-Zr/Sc, La/Y-Zr/Sc, TiO2-Fe2O3T+MgO, Al2O3/SiO2-Fe2O3T+MgO) indicates that their sedimentary sources were felsic rocks from an active continental margin or a continental arc containing a minor amount of recycled sediments derived from a passive continental margin. The Shashi Formation contains detrital zircons that primarily have U-Pb ages of 2.5, 1.8Ga, 725-965, 425-475, 310-350 and 200-260Ma. These results reveal that the pre-Ordovician zircons are derived from recycled sediments of the Yangtze Block and thus originate from the surrounding ranges. The magmatic rocks of the South Qinling Belt and the Jiangnan Orogen are responsible for supplying the Ordovician to Triassic detrital zircons. These provenance data combined with paleocurrent analyses can be used to identify multiple source characteristics in the Jianghan Basin. During the Early Paleocene, most clastic material was derived from a southern source; during the Late Paleocene, northern and western sources contributed most of the detritus to the basin. The supply of clastic material was thus broadly variable and widely dispersed throughout the basin. This study shows that the architecture of the region and the rifting process exerted important influences on this sediment dispersal.},

   abstract = {The Bayin River, the largest river in the northeastern Qaidam basin, plays an important role in the source-to-sink system and landscape evolution at the basin-mountain boundary between the Qilian Mountains and the Qaidam basin in the northern Tibetan Plateau. In this study, we conduct field observation, topographic analysis, zircon U-Pb dating, and apatite (U-Th)/He dating to constrain the landscape and tectonic evolution of the Bayin River watershed. Bedrock zircon U-Pb dating indicates the age group of 420-450 Ma for far-source sediments and the age group of >1,700 Ma for near-source sediments in the Bayin River watershed. Detrital zircon U-Pb dating results from the Mesozoic and Cenozoic strata in the Bayin River watershed reveal that the most important source transition occurred during the Cretaceous. The Zongwulong Mountains gradually uplifted throughout the Cenozoic, along with decreasing far source and increasing near source based on detrital zircon U-Pb dating. Rapid uplift occurred across the Qilian Mountains during the late Cenozoic, leading to high normalized steepness indices, young apatite (U-Th)/He ages, and deep incised valleys at the basin-mountain transition zone. The knickpoints caused by the latest headward erosion just reach an elevation of similar to 3,800 m on the river longitudinal profiles, indicating that the latest uplift magnitude is similar to 300-400 m relative to the basin surface of the Qaidam basin. Elevation distribution and apatite (U-Th)/He ages reveal that river incision leads to high relief in the Zongwulong Mountains and influences its tectonic evolution.},

We have collected a suite of Middle to Late Devonian sedimentary rocks from the Niushoushan Mountains at the southeastern margin of the Alashan Terrane, adjacent to the western margin of the Ordos Basin of the North China Craton (NCC). U-Pb dating and Lu-Hf isotopic studies were carried out on detrital zircons from these rocks. The zircon U-Pb ages define five age populations: 0.4-0.7 Ga (peak at 488 Ma), 1.0-1.3 Ga (peaks at 1001 and 1152 Ma), 1.5-1.8 Ga, 2.4-2.8 Ga (prominent peak at 2506 Ma and secondary peaks at 2668 and 2796 Ma) and >3.0 Ga (peak at 3332 Ma). One detrital zircon yielded a Hadean age of 4022 +/- 17 Ma. Zircons with U-Pb age spectra of 2.4-2.7 and >3.0 Ga and their corresponding epsilon(Hf(t)) values are significantly different from those in the NCC, indicating that these detrital zircons are not from the NCC, which implies that the Alashan Terrane was not part of North China until the Middle to Late Devonian. U-Pb age spectra of zircons dated at 1.0-13 Ga, 2.4-2.7 Ga, and >3.0 Ga, and their corresponding Hf isotope data, have a strong similarity with zircons from East Gondwana and the South China Craton.

   abstract = {The closure age of the North Qilian Ocean, which lay between the Alashan Terrane and Central Qilian Block during the early Palaeozoic, is intensely debated. This article presents a provenance study of detrital materials from three Upper Devonian sedimentary formations in the Pingchuan area of Gansu Province in the eastern North Qilian Orogenic Belt (NQOB), to constrain the tectonic evolution of the belt. U-Pb dating and Lu-Hf isotopic studies were conducted on detrital zircons from samples of sedimentary rocks. Four age populations of U-Pb zircon ages are defined as: 0.5-0.4Ga (peak at 472Ma); 0.8-1.3Ga (peaks at 960Ma and 1102Ma); 1.8-2.1Ga (two prominent peaks at 1963Ma and 2045Ma, and two subordinate peaks at 1816Ma and 2168Ma); and 2.4-2.5Ga (peak at 2495Ma). Zircons with U-Pb age spectra of 1.8-2.1Ga and their corresponding epsilon Hf(t) values are markedly different from those of the North China Block, Dunhuang Terrane, and Central Qilian Block, but have a strong similarity to zircons from the Alashan Terrane. Furthermore, zircons with ages ranging from 1.8 to 2.1Ga are reported for the first time in early Palaeozoic strata of the eastern NQOB. The presence of Alashan-derived clasts in the Upper Devonian strata in the NQOB indicates that the sediments were deposited after amalgamation between the Alashan and Qilian terranes. Combined with previous geochronological and geochemical data from the early Palaeozoic igneous and sedimentary rocks, we propose that the closure of the North Qilian Ocean occurred in the Late Devonian. The similar age spectra of detrital zircons from sediments of the Alashan, Cathaysia, and Australia imply that the Alashan-Qilian-Qaidam block was probably located in the periphery of Gondwana in the early Palaeozoic.},

   abstract = {The Barkol Basin (BB) is an intramontane basin in the easternmost Tian Shan, Northwest China. We reconstructed the tectonic evolution of the BB based on an investigation of its stratigraphy and faults, and we differentiated the basin infill into Quaternary sediments and the Oligocene-Miocene Taoshuyuanzi Formation by combining field observations and geophysical data with borehole data. We used detrital zircon U-Pb dating and palaeo-currents to decipher the provenance of the lower Jurassic Badaowan Formation, which contains the only Mesozoic sediments throughout the easternmost Tian Shan. The results demonstrate that the BB and Harlik Range constitute the main sources. Furthermore, we found that the Taoshuyuanzi Formation unconformably overlies the Palaeozoic basement in the basin, indicating that the BB formed during the Oligocene-Miocene. Based on Magnetotelluric (MT) and seismic profiles, this formation was deposited under the control of basin-bounded faults. According to the field investigation, the boundary faults of the basin were recognized as sinistral strike-slip normal faults. Additionally, remote sensing and electron spin resonance (ESR) data provided valuable information on the Quaternary proluvial fan divisions, which suggest a multi-stage tectonic evolution of the basin during the Quaternary. The Mesozoic-Cenozoic basin evolution in the easternmost Tian Shan was divided into four phases based on an integrated analysis of the stratigraphy and structures of the Santanghu Basin and the Turpan-Hami Basin: (1) from the Late Triassic to the Early-Middle Jurassic, tectonic subsidence dominated the Santanghu Basin and Turpan-Hami Basin; (2) during the Late Jurassic-Eocene, the episodic uplift of the Tian Shan Mountains constricted the Turpan-Hami Basin and the Santanghu Basin; (3) during the Oligocene-Miocene, the BB formed as a subsidence basin controlled by sinistral strike-slip normal faults, and the basins filled with thick layers of clastic rocks; and (4) during the Pliocene-Quaternary, the eastern BB uplifted, and the basins deformed. In conjunction with previous research, the dynamic background of the formation of the BB was presumably related to the clockwise rotation of the Tarim Block to the south and the strong left-lateral movement of the Gobi-Tian Shan fault system.},

   abstract = {Taiwan formed during the Plio-Pleistocene collision of Eurasia with the outboard Luzon arc. Its pre-Tertiary basement, the Tananao metamorphic complex, consists of the western Tailuko belt and the eastern Yuli belt. These circum-Pacific belts have been correlated with the high-temperature/low-pressure (HT/LP) Ryoke belt and the high-pressure/low-temperature (HP/LT) Sanbagawa belt of Japan, respectively. To test this correlation and to reveal the architecture and plate-tectonic history of the Tananao metamorphic basement, detrital zircons were separated from 7 metasedimentary rock samples for U-Pb dating by LA-ICPMS techniques.
Results of the present study, coupled with previous data, show that (1) the Tailuko belt consists of a Late Jurassic to earliest Cretaceous accretionary complex sutured against a Permian-Early Jurassic marble +/- metabasaltic terrane, invaded in the north by scattered Late Cretaceous granitic plutons; the latter as well as minor Upper Cretaceous cover strata probably formed in a circum-Pacific forearc; (2) the Yuli belt is a mid- to Late Cretaceous accretionary complex containing HP thrust sheets that were emplaced attending the Late Cenozoic Eurasian plate-Luzon arc collision; (3) these two Late Mesozoic belts are not coeval, and in part were overprinted by low-grade metamorphism during the Plio-Pleistocene collision; (4) accreted elastic sediments of the Tailuko belt contain mainly Phanerozoic detrital zircons, indicating that terrigenous sediments were mainly sourced from western Cathaysia, whereas in contrast, clastic rocks of the Yuli accretionary complex contain a significant amount of Paleoproterozoic and distinctive Neoproterozoic zircons, probably derived from the North China craton and the Yangtze block +/- eastern Cathaysia, as a result of continent uplift/exhumation after the Permo-Triassic South China-North China collision; and (5) the Late Jurassic-Late Cretaceous formation of the Tananao basement complex precludes the possibility that the early Yanshanian (Early Jurassic) granitoids in southern China represent a landward arc contemporaneous with the later, outboard Tananao accretionary event.

The evidences were obtained for the Lower Triassic (or Middle-Late Triassic) age of the sediments assigned to the Ugokhan series previously classified as Upper Paleozoic. These data indicate that the Lower Mesozoic sedimentary complexes in the structure of this belt are developed much wider than is currently believed. The main sources of clastic material for the Devonian, Carboniferous, and Triassic sedimentary rocks of the Lan terrane were mainly igneous and metamorphic complexes of the North Asian craton framing, along with island arcs. The Lan Terrane can be considered as a fragment of the accretionary complex formed in front of the southeastern margin of the North Asian craton.},

   abstract = {The Mongol-Okhotsk Belt is a major structural element of East Asia. However, a number of important aspects of its evolution remain unresolved, in particular, the timing and scenarios of accretion and collision. This paper presents first detrital zircon U-Pb-Hf and whole-rock Nd isotope data from metasedimentary rocks of the Selemdzha and Tokur terranes in the eastern Mongol-Okhotsk Belt. Our new data suggest that these terranes are not part of a single sedimentary sequence, as has been previously assumed, but likely form a set of thrust sheets. The eastern Mongol-Okhotsk Belt hosts at least two types of accretionary complexes. The first type includes the Talyma, Zlatoust, Sagur-1, Tokur, and Ekimchan formations, which contain abundant Paleoproterozoic and Archean zircons, as well as Paleozoic zircons with two-stage model ages (t(Hf(C))) of 1.7 Ga. These formations are interpreted as fragments of a Paleozoic accretionary complex emplaced at the southern edge of the Siberian Craton. The second type includes the Afanas'ev and Sagur-2 formations, which lack Paleoproterozoic and Archean zircons but contain early Mesozoic zircons with t(Hf(C)) ages of < 1.4 Ga. The Afanas'ev and Sagur-2 formations are probably fragments of an early Mesozoic accretionary complex formed at the northern edge of the Amur Block. Our new model focuses on stratigraphic architecture of the Selemdzha and Tokur terranes and implies that two subduction zones of opposite polarities existed during the suturing of the Mongol-Okhotsk Ocean.},

   abstract = {The early Paleozoic accretionary architecture of the Alxa and Bainaimiao regions in southern Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB) is still ambiguous. In particular, the subduction polarity and tectonic origin of the Bainaimiao Arc are intensely controversial. The Ganqimaodu area in Inner Mongolia provides an excellent window to address this issue. This study presents field and detrital zircon U-Pb-Hf isotopic data of Paleozoic (meta)sedimentary rocks from Ganqimaodu to investigate their provenance and tectonic settings. New field observations show that both the Ondor sum and Hadahushu groups are composed of slightly metamorphosed flysch deposits with pervasive occurrence of "block-in-matrix" structure and isoclinal folds. Two chlorite-quartz schists from the Ondor sum Group yield age peaks at similar to 425, similar to 966, similar to 1590, similar to 1930 and similar to 2564 Ma, and three sandstones from the Hadahushu Group display similar age spectrums with peaks at similar to 443, similar to 586, similar to 960, similar to 1473, similar to 1765 and similar to 2480 Ma. New detrital zircon ages constrain the maximum depositional ages of the Ondor sum and Hadahushu groups to Early Devonian. The Ondor sum and Hadahushu groups are here interpreted as an accretionary complex due to northward subduction of the South Bainaimiao Ocean based on field data and provenance analyses. Our new results combined with previous data suggest bidirectional subduction for the western segment of the South Bainaimiao Ocean during Late Cambrian to Early Devonian. We advocate an archipelago with accretionary complexes, continental fragments, and magmatic arcs for the architecture of the southern CAOB during early Paleozoic, an analogous to modern southwest Pacific accretionary system.},

   abstract = {Sedimentological and geochronological studies along a north-south traverse across the Bangong-Nujiang suture zone (BNSZ) in Gaize, Tibet provide evidence for a Late Triassic-Jurassic accretionary wedge accreted to the south margin of Qiangtang. This wedge, preserved as the Mugagangri Group (MG), records evidence for the northward subduction of the Bangong-Nujiang Ocean (BNO) beneath Qiangtang. The MG strata comprise two coarser intervals (lower olistostromes and upper conglomerates) intercalated within sandy turbidites, which are consistent with timing and forearc stratigraphy during subduction initiation predicted by geodynamic modelling. Following the model, the northward subduction of the BNO beneath Qiangtang and subsequent arc-magmatism are inferred to have begun, respectively, at ca. 220 Ma and ca. 210 Ma, with respect to depositional ages constrained by youngest detrital-zircon ages. The initiation of arc-magmatism is also supported by provenance transition reflected by sandstone detrital modes and age patterns of detrital zircons. Previously, evidence for an incipient arc was lacking, but the timing of Late Triassic BNO subduction and related arc-magmatism is coincident with an important Late Triassic magmatic event in central Qiangtang that probably represents the 'missing' arc. Other Qiangtang events, such as exhumation of the Qiangtang metamorphic belt as a source area, and development of the Late Triassic Nadigangri deposits and bimodal volcanism, are more easily explained in the tectonic context of early northward subduction of the BNO beneath Qiangtang, beginning at about 220 Ma.},

   abstract = {The Lower Jurassic clastic rocks in the Qiangtang Basin, northern Tibet, are generally regarded as the early sediments of the new Mesozoic Qiangtang Basin (Late Triassic to Early Cretaceous). However, little attention has been paid to the palaeoenvironment, provenance, and tectonic setting of this unit. The QZ-16 well, located in the east of the northern Qiangtang Basin, firstly recovered the Lower Jurassic strata (Quemo Co Formation) in the Qiangtang Basin. In this paper, the whole-rock major-trace elemental characteristics of 34 mudstone samples and detrital zircon geochronology of one sandstone, collected from the Quemo Co Formation of the QZ-16 well, are reported in order to infer the palaeoenvironment, provenance, and tectonic setting. Quemo Co mudstones are dominated by SiO2 and Al2O3, while Fe2O3, CaO, K2O, and MgO are the second most abundant oxides. They are generally characterized by high REE concentrations, enrichment in light rare earth elements (LREEs), marked negative Eu and Ce anomalies. The REE contents of the mudstones are mainly controlled by terrigenous detrital minerals input. The Lower Jurassic mudstones have relatively high chemical index of alteration (79.1-83.6) values, indicating moderate to high degree of chemical weathering conditions of the source area. Sr/Ba and Rb/K ratios reflect that the marine transgression impact was limited and the mudstones were generally deposited in a brackish water environment. Major, trace, and REE contents indicate that the mudstones were mainly derived from intermediate igneous rocks with subordinate felsic igneous rocks. Prominent age peaks at ca. 200 similar to 400 Ma, 700 similar to 970 Ma, 1,700 similar to 1,900 Ma, and 2,100 similar to 2,700 Ma of the detrital zircon grains suggest that the Lower Jurassic clastic rocks were derived from the Central Qiangtang and Songpan-Ganzi complex. Moreover, tectonic discrimination diagrams based on major and trace elements show that the source of the Lower Jurassic sediments were most likely derived from a collision tectonic setting.},

   abstract = {A petroleum system originating from Jurassic source rocks exists in Altyn piedmont. However, the Jurassic formation in this system is deformed by Yanshan-Himalayan tectonic movement, and related studies about its spatial distribution and sedimentary system are still highly controversial. In general, a systematic research on the provenance system helps precisely restoring the prototype basin. Based on the methods of seismic characterization, sedimentary analysis, and detrital zircon U-Pb dating (samples from several Altyn piedmont outcrops), this paper studied the provenances of Jurassic formation in Altyn piedmont and characterized their distribution from different aspects: (1) Lacustrine rift basin developed in the study area at early Jurassic, while the formation showed a saucer shape with its thickness decreasing and vanishing towards the center of the basin in the middle Jurassic; in summary, the Jurassic formation in Altyn piedmont could be divided into several parts due to their different characteristics in different periods. (2) The south part of the Jurassic deposition (south of Qingshuigou) could come from the east Kunlun terrain; the middle part (Yueya mountain to Dongping area) however could be from several provenances, including the east Kunlun terrain, the surrounding plutons, and the Altyn fault; the north part (Niudong to north Lenghu area) is mainly related to the Altyn fault. (3) The Altyn fault, a regional fault system containing several strike-slip faults, is highly active since late Triassic and controls the current spatial distribution of the Jurassic formation; the faulted area in the piedmont could be separated into several parts with several different sources. (4) Compared to the southern and middle parts, the northern Jurassic deposition is relatively flat and contains wider and thicker source rock beds, which makes this area an important gas exploration target.},

In terms of the closure of the Mesotethys, previous sedimentological research has focused on the BNM, while the SNM remains insufficient. On the basis of detrital zircon dating and sedimentologic data, in this study, we determined the existence of Aptian deep-marine turbidites in the Zhongcang and Lhakorco areas of the SNM. Sandstone petrographic and detrital zircon analysis combine to show that the Zhongcang turbidites provide records of the recycled from the accretionary complex and Triassic-Jurassic strata in the southern Qiangtang margin, with the minor addition of Qiangtang magmatic arc rocks, while sediments in the Lhakorco turbidites were derived mainly from recycled orogen source and Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous magmatic arc in the Lhasa Terrane. Further analysis suggests that the Aptian turbidites were deposited in a deep-marine oceanic basin of Mesotethys and this oceanic basin prevented Qiangtang-derived sediments transported onto the Lhasa terrane. The Mesotethys experienced diachronic closure from east to west during the Early Cretaceous, and the final closure was most likely completed along the SNM after Aptian.},

   abstract = {Few studies have focused their attentions on the source-to-sink (S2S) system from a multiple-level perspective. We have proposed an effective multilevel S2S subdivision approach based on the integrated study of seismic geomorphology, well-based facies, seismic facies and multi-attribute. The inspiration of multilevel S2S subdivision method is drawn mainly from the modern Diancang Mountain-Lake Erhai S2S system with different-orders of drainage divides. The Paleogene Central Uplift system during the syn-rift stage in Xijiang Sag, Pearl River Mouth Basin, South China Sea, provides a suitable example to test the approach and analyze the multilevel S2S characteristics of an ancient uplift system. The result shows that the Central Uplift system can be divided into three second-level sub-S2S systems (R-A, R-B and R-C), and can be further sub-divided into twelve third-level sub-S2S systems (A1 similar to A5, B1 similar to B5 and C1 similar to C2). Generally, the A1 similar to A5 and B1 similar to B4 systems are developed at the gentle slopes and deposited a series of narrow-shaped braided deltas with higher exploration potential, whereas the B5 and C1 similar to C2 systems are developed at the relatively steep slopes and deposited a series of lobate shaped turbidite and fan deltas with lower reservoir quality. Based on the multilevel S2S analysis, the ancient uplift can be scientifically sub-divided and compared with each sub-S2S system, including the sediment-transport type and distance, sedimentary facies characteristics and stacking relationship with the hydrocarbon source rocks. These in-depth and detailed studies have practical significance for the exploration of favorable reservoir sandbodies and stratigraphic-lithologic traps.},

   abstract = {The Early Cretaceous sedimentary successions in the Jiaodong-Laiyang (Jiaolai) Basin provide valuable information about sediment provenances and tectonic processes. A clear understanding of the provenance development of the Jiaolai Basin along the northern margin of the Sulu orogen and would elucidate the exhumation history of the Sulu orogen during the post-orogenic period. However, the precise age and provenance evolution of the stratigraphy remain ambiguous. Here, we employ multiple provenance proxies detailed paleocurrent, conglomerate clast counts, detrital composition point counts of sandstone, and detrital zircon U-Pb geochronology to reconstruct - the source-to-sink system of the northern part of the Jiaolai Basin. Visual and statistical analyses of the different proxy results and comparison with the signatures of potential source regions reveal that (1) Wawukuang Formation (Fm) (ca. 123 Ma) was mainly sourced from the Guocheng uplift in both the Haiyang and Laiyang regions; (2) Linsishan to Zhifengzhuang Fm (ca. 121 Ma), the Laiyang region was mainly fed by the Jiaobei terrane, while in the Haiyang region, the Guocheng uplift and Sulu orogen were primary sources; (3) Shuinan to Longwangzhuang Fm, the Haiyang and Laiyang regions were linked as a single basin fed by the Jiaobei terrane and Sulu orogen; and (4) Qugezhuang Fm (ca. 114 Ma) was mainly sourced from Early Cretaceous plutons in the Sulu orogen and Jiaobei terrane. Based on the inflection point in the proportion of ages of the ultrahigh-pressure metamorphic (UHP) rocks between the Wawukuang and Linsishan Fms, we conclude that the Sulu belt experienced a rapid uplift that resulted in the exposure and erosion of the Jurassic plutons and UHP rocks during ca. 123-121 Ma. In addition, our results show that the denudation processes of the Mesozoic plutons in the Sulu orogen have an obvious temporal sequence: Jurassic plutons first, followed by Cretaceous plutons.},

The early Paleozoic strata (the Dahuangshan Formation and Xiangshan Group) of the southern and eastern Aixa Block have consistent rock compositions, similar depositional ages, paleocurrents, detrital zircon age distributions, and cumulative probability curves of crystallization ages for detrital zircon grains relative to the depositional ages, and were deposited in similar slope basins. All these data indicate that the early Paleozoic strata of the Alxa Block were sourced predominantly from Neoproterozoic orogenic belts in the eastern Gondwana continent, instead of the Alxa Block to the north, the North China Block to the east and the North Qilian Orogenic Belt to the south. During the early Paleozoic, the Alxa Block was an independent block with the South China Block (SCB) to the west and the North China Block (NCB) to the east and situated to the northwest of the eastern Gondwana with its long axis trending north northwest-south southeast, and it belonged to a passive continental margin dipping to the north northwest, with the eastern part of the margin located closer to the eastern Gondwana. The Hexi Corridor is part of the Alxa Block and a part of the same slope basin during the early Paleozoic. The southern boundary of the Alxa Block is now the front thrust of the North Qilian Shan.

   abstract = {Long-lived subduction and accretion of the Paleo-Asian Ocean (PAO) led to the formation of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB). The central part of the southern CAOB is crucial to understand the tectonic evolution of the entire CAOB. However, the Paleozoic evolution and the final closure of the central PAO are controversial, and the nature of the Early Paleozoic basins is confusing. The relatively complete Paleozoic strata are well-preserved in Zhusileng area in the central part of the southern CAOB and provide an ideal object to constrain the Paleozoic tectonic setting of the PAO. In this study, detrital zircon U-Pb dating and sedimentological and paleocurrents analyses are conducted on the Cambrian-Devonian strata and Lower Permian strata. Most detrital zircons from the Cambrian-Devonian strata have Precambrian ages, while the detrital zircons from the Lower Permian strata are mainly of Paleozoic age. The North China Craton, Alxa Block and Tarim Craton are not the provenances of the Cambrian-Devonian strata. The central part of the southern CAOB was located in a passive continental margin setting during the Cambrian to Ordovician and received the detritus from the Beishan Orogenic Belt. During the Silurian to Middle Devonian, a nearly east-west-trending foreland basin that resulted from the collision between the Zhusileng-Hangwula terrane and southern Mongolian microcontinent developed. From the Late Devonian to Early Permian, bidirectional subduction of the PAO occurred between the Alxa Block and Zhusileng-Hangwula terrane, resulting in numerous arc-related magmatic rocks. Detritus in the Lower Permian strata was mainly from the Paleozoic magmatic rocks and Cambrian-Devonian strata in Zhusileng and surrounding areas. The Late Paleozoic shortening deformation and the switch of the tectonic setting from subduction/collision to post-collision occurred in the central part of the southern CAOB imply that the central PAO closed between the Early and Late Permian.

However, there are few such records at the southern margin of the North China Craton (NCC), limiting the comparison of the glacial deposits with other parts of the world. In this study, five sections of the Neoproterozoic Luoquan Formation were investigated in a systematic field survey using traditional sedimentology, geochemistry, and geochronology methods to reveal genesis, paleoclimate, paleoenvironment, and provenance of the Luoquan Formation. The results reveal depositional evidence for glaciation, such as sedimentary characteristics of massive diamictites, bedded and weakly bedded diamictites, sandstone lenses, lonestone-bearing siltstone, glacial relics, and striated pavements. All geochemical indicators show positive trends, such as in the values of Fe/Mn, Mg/Ga, Sr/Ba, sigma REE, and Cu/Zn. The zircon U-Pb data of the stable sandstone strata in the Luoquan Formation show a main peak at 2494 million years (Ma) and secondary peaks at 1656, 2100, and 2233 Ma. Sedimentary characteristics, glacial relics, changes in geochemical values, and the provenance age of detrital zircons suggest that the Luoquan Formation represents glacial meltwater deposits that eroded the nearby strata in a gradually warming environment. The direction of glacier migration, from north to south, revealed that the NCC deposition process occurred in the late Neoproterozoic.},

The U-Pb ages of detrital zircons from the ore-bearing member are ranging from 117 to 270 Ma and 370-480 Ma, respectively, indicating that the provenance and uranium source were mainly derived from the Permian-Triassic intermediate-acid igneous rocks in the eastern Altyn Tagh and western Saishiteng Mountains, a small amount of them are from the Ordovician-Silurian intermediate-acid igneous rocks in the Xiaosaishiteng Mountains. Two types of ores in Xiaomigou Formation in Lenghu region are mainly composed of graywacke and carbonaceous sandstone with main uranium minerals are coffinite, pitchblende and trace amounts of lead selenite. They are closely associated with clay minerals, organics and pyrite, which lie in the intergranular space of quartz, feldspar and other altered lithic mineral grains or in cleavage joints of altered clay minerals that occur in fine columnar, gel-like or irregular sawtooth shape. It is inferred that the Fe2+ in feldspar and biotite reacts with H2S or S-2(-) bearing minerals participated in the formation of pyrite, where the U6+ was captured by late multiple fluid processes occurred reduction-precipitation-adsorption uranium mineralization in the reduction environment provided by Fe2+. Based on the analysis of the existence of high Y and low Y types of uranium minerals, it is inferred that uranium in uranium minerals is the residual of original uranium minerals derived from the pre-enrichment of uranium-bearing detrital particles in sedimentary and diagenetic stages, and at the later stage, the high radioactivity abnormal geological bodies migrated to the inner basin through the multi-stage reformation of uranium-containing and oxygen-containing fluids without Y or at very low contents.},

   abstract = {The eastern segment of Central Asian Orogenic Belt underwent not only a long evolution history related to the Paleo-Asian Ocean during Paleozoic but also the tectonic overprinting by the westward subduction of Paleo-Pacific Ocean crust during Mesozoic. When the subduction of Paleo-Pacific Ocean crust started has been long debated issue for understanding the tectonic evolution of the eastern Asian continental margin. The eastern margin of the Jimusi Block (Wandashan Terrane) preserved complete records for the accretionary process of the westward subduction of Paleo-Pacific Ocean crust. Comprising the Yuejinshan Complex and Raohe Accretionary Complex (RAC), the Wandashan Terrane is located in the eastern margin of Jiamusi Block, NE China, and is considered to be an accretionary wedge of the westward subducting oceanic crust. To reconstruct the marginal accretion processes of the Jiamusi Block, the structural deformation of the Wandashan Terrane was investigated in the field and the geochronology of the Dalingqiao and Yongfuqiao formations were studied, which were formed syn-and-post RAC accretion respectively. The Yuejinshan and Raohe complexes were discontinuously accreted to the eastern margin of the Jiamusi Block. Contrary to the previous consideration of the Late Triassic to Early Jurassic, this study suggests that the Yuejianshan Complex in southwest Wandashan Terrane probably accreted from Late Carboniferous to Middle Permian, which was driven by unknown oceanic crust subduction existing to the east (present position) of the Jiamusi Block at that time. The siltstones of the Dalingqiao Fm. yield the youngest zircon U-Pb age of 142 +/- 2Ma, indicating the emplacement of the RAC not earlier than the Late Jurassic. Thus, the RAC might start to accrete from the Jurassic and emplace during 142-131 Ma, resulted from the Paleo-Pacific subduction which started from the Late Triassic to Early Jurassic.

   abstract = {Several tectonic models have been proposed for the Neoproterozoic amalgamation of the South China block during the assembly of Rodinia. However, the timing of the end of arc magmatism between the two subblocks in the South China block (i.e., the Yangtze and Cathaysia blocks) remains controversial because it is unclear whether the 860-820 Ma magmatic rocks and coeval sedimentary basins in this area are related to subduction or plume activity. Here, we present new detrital zircon U-Pb and Hf isotopic data for the sediments directly overlying early Neoproterozoic arc volcanic rocks in this region. These data reveal a rhythmic change in source coincident with a progressive increase in the amount of juvenile and old crustal detritus within these sediments. This result, combined with the presence of a fining-upward grain-size trend and horizontal bedding within these sediments, provides evidence of bidirectional sources that are consistent with a backarc setting. The juvenile crustal material within these sediments was sourced from adjacent arc terranes to the east, whereas the old crustal detritus was derived from the Yangtze block to the west. In addition, sensitive high-resolution ion microprobe zircon U-Pb dating of mafic rocks within equivalent sedimentary sequences yielded ages of ca. 860-840 Ma, and these mafic rocks have arc-or mid-ocean-ridge basalt-like geochemical features that indicate the initiation of backarc spreading associated with Neoproterozoic NW-directed subduction. The data from the sediments and mafic rocks suggest the presence of a backarc basin system at ca. 860-820 Ma within the eastern margin of the Yangtze block. This in turn indicates that Rodinia assembly was not completed until ca. 820 Ma, with the South China block possibly acting as a connection between a Neoproterozoic Andean-type active continental margin and Grenvillian belts on the paleo-western margin of the Rodinia supercontinent.},

   abstract = {The age spectra obtained from 505 spots of detrital zircon U-Pb ages of five representative sandstone samples from the Sanjiang Basin in NE China point to a significant change in its provenance during the Coniacian-Santonian. The predominant detrital source for the Sanjiang Basin during the early Cretaceous was the Zhangguangcai Range magmatic belt and Jiamusi Block along its western and southern periphery, whereas it changed in the late Cretaceous to its eastern periphery. The timing of these inferred changes in the detrital source regions and drainage patterns nearly coincide with the age of a regional unconformity in and across the basin. The time interval of non-deposition and unconformity development was coeval with a transitional period between an extensional tectonic regime in the early Cretaceous and a contractional deformation episode in the late Cretaceous. The Sanjiang Basin evolved during this time window from a backarc to a foreland basin. The migration of the coastal orogenic belt and the fold and thrust belt development farther inland during the late Cretaceous marked the onset of regional-scale shortening and surface uplift in the upper plate of a flat (or very shallow-dipping) subduction zone. The stratigraphic record, the detrital source and geochronology of the basinal strata, and the internal structure of the Sanjiang Basin present, therefore, an important record of a tectonic switch in the nature of continental margin evolution of Northeast Asia during the late Mesozoic.

   abstract = {The origin and provenance of the loess deposits of the Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP) are still debated. In order to pinpoint the dust sources, surface samples from the piedmont of the Northeastern Tibetan Plateau, the Gobi Altai Mountains, and modern eolian dunes from the Tengger desert and Mu Us sand field were analyzed by using the detrital zircon dating technique. In order to quantitatively discriminate the content of different potential sources, zircon grains of different ages were grouped according to their tectonic origin. Zircon grains aged from 1300 to 550Ma were assigned to the Northeastern Tibetan Plateau, and grains aged from 550 to 0Ma to the Northeastern Tibetan Plateau or the Gobi Altai Mountains, or to a combination of the two. Zircon ages of around 2.8Ga to 1.3Ga may be a mixture of sources from the Northeastern Tibetan Plateau, Gobi Altai Mountains, or North China Craton. Sediments from the Tengger desert and Mu Us sand field consist of a mixture of the three sources and exhibit a high degree of spatial variability in terms of their source. In the northern part of the two deserts, 43-83% of the sediments are derived from the Gobi Altai Mountains, while in the south, material from the Northeastern Tibetan Plateau comprises 51-98% of the sediments. Loess deposits from the CLP also comprise a mixture of the three different sources, with material from the Northeastern Tibetan Plateau making the dominant contribution (65-100%), with material from the North China Craton and the Gobi Altai Mountains comprising 0-35% and 0-40% of the loess deposits, respectively. The contributions from the three sources to the loess deposits on CLP vary spatially. Application of the novel statistical method of provenance group analysis demonstrates that the loess deposits comprise a mixture of material from a broad region of northern China and that the Northeastern Tibetan Plateau material makes the dominant contribution.},

   abstract = {The southwestern Ordos Margin is located between the Alax massif to the northwest, the North China Craton (NCC) to the east, and the North Qilian Orogenic Belt (NQOB, part of the Chinese Central Orogenic belt) to the southeast. Controversy surrounds the tectonic setting of the Western Ordos Margin in the Early Paleozoic; key questions are whether the Alax massif connected to the NCC in the Early Paleozoic, when exactly this event did happen, where the Lower Paleozoic sedimentary rocks along the southwestern Ordos had their provenances, and whether the so-called Helan aulacogen formed in the Ordovician. Laser-ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy U-Pb dating of detrital zircons in four samples from Middle Ordovician sandstones in the Xiaoluo Shan and Niushou Shan located in the Western Ordos yield a majority of Pb-206/U-238 ages between 800 and 1000 Ma, a smaller group yields Pb-206/U-238 ages between 500 and 600 Ma; there are a few zircons with other ages, including some older than 2400 Ma. The youngest Pb-206/U-238 ages of the four samples are similar and range from 533 +/- 3 Ma to 556 +/- 4 Ma. These zircon U-Pb ages combined with several lines of sedimentary evidence imply that the so-called Helan aulacogen did not exist in the Ordovician; a peripheral foreland basin related to the NQOB developed instead. The detritals mainly came from the Alax massif, the North Qilian Arc, and the Dunhuang massif; and the NCC can be excluded as an important provenance. This study also suggested that the Alax massif did not connect with the NCC before the Middle Ordovician, and that the Alax is similar to the Yangtze Craton or the Tarim Craton with a majority of intrusions in the range of 800-1000 Ma and containing Precambrian tillites, which are characteristics that differ from the NCC.

Here, the mechanisms and evolution of the Xining Basin during the Cenozoic were investigated by studying the sedimentary facies of 22 Cenozoic sections across the basin and detrital zircon U-Pb ages of three Cenozoic sections located in the eastern, central and western basin, respectively. In the Eocene (ca. 50-44Ma), the India-Eurasia Collision affected the northeastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. The Central Qilian Block rotated clockwise by ca. 24 degrees to form the Xining Basin. The Triassic flysch sediments surrounding the basin were the primary sources of sediment. Between ca. 44-40Ma, the basin enlarged and deepened, and sedimentation was dominated by saline lake sediments. Between ca. 40-25.5Ma, the Xining Basin began to shrink and dry, resulting in the deposition of saline pan and saline mudflat sediments in the basin. After ca. 20Ma, the Laji Shan to the south of the Xining Basin was uplifted due to the northward compression of the Guide Basin to the south. Clasts that eroded from this range dominated the sediments as the basin evolved from a lacustrine environment into a fluvial system. The Xining Basin was an extensional basin in the Early Cenozoic, but changed into a compressive one during the Late Cenozoic, it was not a foreland basin either to the Kunlun Shan or to the western Qinling Shan in the whole Cenozoic. The formation and deformation of the Xining Basin are the direct responses of the India-Eurasia Collision and the growth of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau.},

   abstract = {The tectonic evolution of the Xing'an-Inner Mongolia Orogenic Belt (XIMOB) in the southeastern segment of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt is not well understood. It is arguable whether the Paleo-Asian Ocean was closed in Devonian or Early Mesozoic and whether the tectonic regimes during Carboniferous and Permian were operated by continuous subduction-arc systems or extension after the orogenic process. Comprehensive studies of metamorphism for four metamorphic terranes including the Ondor Sum Group, Baoyintu Group, Xilingol Complex, and early Triassic metamorphic sequences in central Inner Mongolia provide good constraints on the arguable issues about the XIMOB. According to the zircon U-Pb dating analyses in this study, quartz schists of the Ondor Sum Group in the northern and southern orogenic belts (NOB and SOB) have a broad detrital zircon age range from late Archean to early Paleozoic with a similar youngest deposition age of 434-430 Ma, but have different zircon age populations with a similar to 650 Ma peak for the NOB but not for the SOB. Biotite gneisses of the Xilingol Complex have age populations and the youngest deposition age of 436 Ma similar to the Ondor Sum Group in the NOB. Amphibolites in the complex have a metamorphic zircon age of 321 +/- 3 Ma and hornblende Ar-40/Ar-39 age of 309 +/- 2 Ma. The early Triassic metamorphic sequences, metabasites in Wulangou and mica-schists in Shuangjing both have broad zircon age ranges from the late Archean to late Paleozoic. Their protoliths are constrained to have formed later than 258 Ma and 261 Ma respectively and the metamorphism occurred soon afterwards in the Early Triassic constrained by an actinolite Ar-40-Ar-39 age of 241 +/- 19 Ma in metabasite and a muscovite Ar-40-Ar-39 age of 240 +/- 2 Ma in mica-schist. Combined with the results previously published, this study identified four phases of metamorphism in central Inner Mongolia since Paleozoic. The Silurian (430-426 Ma) high P/T metamorphism of the Ondor Sum Group was related to bidirectional subduction processes. The Devonian (similar to 400 Ma) medium P/T metamorphism of the Baoyintu Group suggests a crustal thickening orogeny. The Carboniferous (337-321 Ma) low P/T metamorphism of the Xilingol Complex is indicative of an extension process of a previous orogen. The Early Triassic (similar to 240 Ma) extensive medium-low P/T metamorphism along the Solonker suture zone was attributed to the closure of limited ocean basins. Thus, an alternative tectonic scenario for the metamorphic terranes in central Inner Mongolia involves: (i) the early Paleozoic trench-arc system (500-425 Ma); (ii) the Devonian collisional orogeny due to closure of the Paleo-Asian-Ocean (400-360 Ma); (iii) the Carboniferous and Permian extension after the collision (350-250 Ma), and (iv) the Early Triassic within-plate orogeny due to the closure of limited ocean basins (similar to 240 Ma).},

The main source of Lower-Middle Devonian sediments was the Early Paleozoic North Qilian Orogenic Belt.

The deformation of the Cambrian and Devonian Systems in the southeastern Alxa Block indicates that a strong east west compression event occurred in the study area before the Early Carboniferous. The paleocurrents of the Upper Devonian in the southeastern Alxa Block indicate that the source was located to the north and was not the North Qilian Orogenic Belt to the south. Moreover, the deposition of the Upper Devonian in the southeastern Alxa Block was a response to a strong deformation event that occurred along the eastern boundary of the Alxa Block during the Late Devonian and Early Carboniferous. The North China Block became the primary source during the Early Carboniferous, and the Alxa Block was a minor source. A regional stratigraphic comparison also indicates that similar depositional environments were present until the Carboniferous and Permian on the Alxa Block and North China Block.

   abstract = {Located on the south of the Gangdese, the Qiuwu Formation has traditionally been considered as Eocene coal-bearing clastic sediments consisting of sandstone, mudstone and conglomerate, uncon-formably on top of Gangdese batholith. However, its precise age and depositional environment remain ambiguous. Here, we present a newly measured stratigraphic section near the Ngamring County, western Xigaze. Detrital zircon UePb ages were also applied to trace the provenance of sediments and to constrain the maximum depositional age of the Qiuwu Formation. Sedimentary facies analyses indicate subaqueous fan and alluvial fan depositional environments. Clast composition of the conglomerate is dominated by magmatic rocks at the lower part, while chert and mafic detritus occur in the upper part, suggesting a southern source. Sandstone modal analyses indicate that the compositions of quartz, feldspar and lithic grains changed from transitional arc to dissected arc, implying the unroofing of the Gangdese arc. Detrital zircon UePb ages of the Qiuwu Formation are compared with those from Gangdese magmatic rocks and Yarlung-Zangbo ophiolites, suggesting that the Gangdese arc is a main source of the Qiuwu detritus and that the southern source played a role during the later stage. The major peak of detrital zircon ages is at 45-55 Ma, which corresponds to Linzizong volcanic rocks in southern Gangdese arc. The weighted mean age of the five youngest zircons from the lower part of the section is 21.0 +/- 2.2 Ma, suggesting that the Qiuwu Formation was deposited in early Miocene, coeval with other conglomerates exposed along the southern margin of Gangdese. Combining new observations with previously published data, we propose that the provenance of the Qiuwu Formation had shifted from a single northern source to double sources from both the north and the south. Activities of Great Counter Thrust were primarily responsible for the shift by making the south area a high elevation to provide sediments for the Qiuwu Formation.

   abstract = {The South China Block was subject to widespread tectonic and magmatic events during the middle Ordovician to earliest Devonian which are collectively called the Wuyi-Yunkai orogeny. Two different hypotheses were formulated about the origin of the orogeny: collisional orogenesis and intracontinental orogenesis. Ages of 215 detrital zircons were obtained from quartz sandstones in the Lower Devonian Danlin Formation exposed in Dushan County, south Guizhou Province. The results show that the detrital zircons came from multiple source areas but with little indication of the Wuyi-Yunkai orogeny. The detrital zircons of early Paleozoic age account only for 1.9% of all samples. These zircons range from 476 to 402 Ma and originated from the early Paleozoic granites situated east of Dushan County. The mean Pb-206/U-238 age of the two youngest detrital zircons was 404 Ma, which constrains the maximum depositional age of the Danlin Formation. The detrital zircons are mostly within Neoproterozoic age (59.5%) and in the range 997 to 557 Ma. The zircon age pattern, morphology, and trace element characteristics combined with paleogeographic reconstruction interpret that these detrital zircons were supplied from igneous rocks in the Neoproterozoic Sibao and Danzhou Groups within the west Jiangnan orogen to the east of the study area. Mesoproterozoic zircons made up 20.9% of the grains and range from 1569 to 1055 Ma; the ages of most of these zircons coincide with those of zircons indicating the Grenvillian orogeny (1300-1000 Ma) in the Cathaysia Plate. The detrital zircon age data reveal that the study area was located in an intracontinental tectonic setting, both before and after the Wuyi-Yunkai orogeny. Therefore, the Cathaysia Plate was not separated from the Yangtze Plate by an ocean and the study area received sediments primarily from the Cathaysia Plate located to the southeast since the middle Ordovician. By the early Devonian, the sediments were supplied by the west Jiangnan orogen. Although a source change was caused by WuyiYunkai orogeny, our data imply that this orogeny represented an intracontinental event rather than an orogenesis involving subduction-collision and joining of the Yangtze and Cathaysia Plates during the early Paleozoic.

   abstract = {In this contribution, we present new petrological, geochemical, zircon U-Pb and Hf isotopic data for eclogitic metasediments from the north Qilian orogenic belt, in which early Paleozoic ophiolitic sequences and HP/LT metamorphic rocks have been previously recognized. The studied metasediments contain eclogite facies assemblages reflecting P-T conditions of 450-560 degrees C and 1.9-2.4 GPa, consistent with those of adjacent eclogites. REE compositions of the eclogitic metasediments overlap those of average upper continental crust. The SHRIMP and LA-MC-ICPMS U-Pb data of zircons from metasediments demonstrate input from sources with major age components about 500 Ma and 1600-1900 Ma (peak at similar to 1800 Ma), with a smaller population at 660-800 Ma (peak at 750 Ma), and minor >1.9 Ga zircon ages. The youngest detrital zircons suggest a maximum depositional age of ca. 475 Ma, and combined with P-T conditions and previously determined metamorphic age suggest a burial rate of >0.6-0.7 cm/yr. Zircon Hf isotopic analyses show that 500 Ma zircons have positive epsilon Hf(t) (mainly between +8 and +16). By contrast, Meso- to Paleoproterozoic detrital zircons show a broad spectrum of epsilon Hf(t) (mainly between -5 and +10) with TDMHf of 1800-2500 Ma. These data suggest that eclogitic metasediments are derived from a mixture of Proterozoic continent crust and juvenile early Paleozoic oceanic and/or island arc crust, and their protoliths likely were deposited in a terrigenous-dominated continental margin basin rather than a pelagic oceanic crust environment. The new results are consistent with subduction erosion of the active continental margin during south-dipping subduction, as these sediments, formed in a fore-arc environment close to the Qilian block to the south, were transported in the subduction zone to 60-70 km depth prior to their exhumation.

   abstract = {One hundred and forty-four and fifty-two Mesozoic sandstone samples from the Qiangtang block (ca. 32 degrees 20'-35 degrees N, 85 degrees-93 degrees E; northern Tibet, China) were conducted for analysis of detrital modes and heavy-mineral spectra, respectively, in an attempt to evaluate their provenance and the type of tectonic setting in which they were deposited. The Lower-Middle Triassic sandstones in central Qiangtang are characterized by complex derivations from both recycled orogen and continental block provenances. Most of the Upper Triassic and Jurassic sandstones are dominated by a recycled-orogen origin. However, sandstones derived from a continental-block source also occur in Upper Triassic strata in the southern margin of southern Qiangtang, and in Lower Jurassic strata in the southern margin of northern Qiangtang. Although the heavy-mineral spectra of the Upper Triassic and Jurassic sandstones are occupied mostly by the stable heavy minerals zircon, tourmaline, and rutile (ZTR), most of the samples are generally accompanied by unstable heavy minerals, such as apatite, chlorite, chrome spinel, amphibole, epidote, garnet, and pyroxene, except for those from Upper Triassic strata in the southern margin of southern Qiangtang and from Lower Jurassic strata in the southern margin of northern Qiangtang. The detrital modes and heavy-mineral spectra of the Mesozoic sandstones, along with the lithologic evidence, indicate that the central Qiangtang anticlinorium must have been elevated and eroding due to orogenesis and most likely has contained rolling topographic relief at least since Early Triassic time. It could have contained abundant ophiolitic fragments as evidenced by rich chrome spinel, amphibole, and other readily decomposed ferromagnesian minerals across the entire anticlinorium. These mafic minerals may point to the presence of the Shuanghu suture along the entire central Qiangtang anticlinorium. The blueschist-bearing metamorphic complexes in central Qiangtang could be accommodated in a large-scale enclave in an irregular central Qiangtang continental margin. The Upper Triassic-Jurassic recycled-orogen-derived sandstones in northeastern Qiangtang suggest continued orogenesis due to the suturing between Qiangtang and Asia. Such a contractional background does not support models that relate a tensile mechanism for back-arc spreading along the Bangong-Nujiang belt.},

   abstract = {The West Kunlun Orogenic Belt is a result of the closure of Proto-and Paleo-Tethys Ocean and subsequent continental collision. In order to better understand the tectonic evolution of this orogenic belt, whole-rock geochemistry of major and trace elements, detrital zircon U-Pb geochronology and Lu-Hf isotopic composition were determined for metasediments of the Kangxiwa Group (KG) in the South Kunlun Terrane (SKT). These rocks have low Chemical Index of Alteration and high Index of Compositional Variability values, indicating relatively weak chemical weathering and a source compositionally dominated by immature material that lacks alumina-rich minerals. The rocks are all enriched in light rare earth element and display relatively flat heavy rare earth element patterns. Their low contents of ferromagnesian (e.g. Cr, Co and Ni) and high field strength elements (e.g. Zr, Hf, Nb, Ta and Y) are similar to those of graywackes from active continental margins. Detrital zircons from three samples of the KG metasediments can be divided into igneous and metamorphic grains. Zircon U-Pb dating of the igneous grains shows similar age spectra dominated by Early Paleozoic to late Paleozoic ages. The Precambrian igneous grains yield Neoproterozoic Pb-206/U-238 ages and a few early Mesoproterozoic to Paleoproterozoic Pb-207/Pb-206 ages. The youngest igneous zircons define the maximum depositional age at similar to 307 Ma for the KG metasediments. The U-Pb dating of all the metamorphic grains yield Pb-206/U-238 ages at similar to 245 Ma, suggesting the metasediment rocks were deposited prior to the early Triassic. These results indicate that the KG metasediments were deposited on an active continental margin during the time between late Carboniferous and late Permian. Lu-Hf isotopic analyses of the igneous detrital zircons from the three samples show large variations of epsilon(Hf)(t) values mostly between - 21 and + 12. Combined with their U-Pb ages, two respective crustal growth events are identified in the SKT at the Early Paleozoic and the late Carboniferous.

   abstract = {Unraveling the character and source of late Mesoproterozoic-early Neoproterozoic sedimentary sequences is crucial in constraining Rodinia reconstructions. We carried out an integrated geochemical, zircon U-Pb geochronological and Lu-Hf isotopic study of the Shilu Group and the overlying Shihuiding Formation in Hainan, South China. These two successions are chemically mature and dominated by siliceous components. The Shilu Group was mainly derived from felsic arc lithologies whereas the Shihuiding Formation was from recycled sedimentary materials and records a transition from convergent to passive margin settings during the late Mesoproterozoic-early Neoproterozoic in Hainan. Detrital zircons from the Shilu Group and Shihuiding Formation yield similar age populations, with maximum depositional ages of similar to 1,100-1,000 Ma and similar to 900 Ma, respectively. The Shilu Group matches well with the Kunyang Group outcropped in the Yangtze Block in depositional age, detrital zircon age populations and Lu-Hf isotopic compositions, and geochemical characteristics, whereas the Shihuiding Formation exhibits significantly different detrital age populations from the Wanquan Group in the Cathaysia Block. This indicates that Hainan was linked to the Yangtze Block rather than the Cathaysia Block in the late Mesoproterozoic-early Neoproterozoic. The Shilu and Kunyang groups have similar detrital age patterns to the late Mesoproterozoic to early Neoproterozoic strata in northwest India and are distinct from their equivalents in west Laurentia, suggesting an external location of Hainan-Yangtze in Rodinia.},

   abstract = {The Daqingshan area in China located in the center part of the Khondalite belt, north of the Ordos Block and south of the Yinshan Block. The Daqingshan basin is the best-preserved Mesozoic basin that is oriented nearly east-west. Previous studies suggest that the provenance of Jurassic sediment is mainly the Khondalite belt and no material from Yinshan Block. We present detailed data on the detrital-zircon geochronology of the Jurassic sandstones from the Daqingshan area. The detrital-zircon U-Pb age data of the Wudanggou and Changhangou Formations show two peaks at similar to 2450 Ma and 1970-1930 Ma, with a few of Archean ages. The detrital-zircon age data of the Daqingshan Formation show three distinctive age populations of 2560-2460 Ma, 1950-1750 Ma, and 320-265 Ma. Comparison with the age of the surrounding magmatic rocks suggests that the main source area is the Wulashan-Daqingshan Complex, with the Yinshan Block being a lesser source. However, more Archean and Paleozoic detrital zircon occurs in the Daqingshan Formation, probably as a result of the rise of the western part of the basin and eastward movement of the center of the basin, thereby increasing provenance from the Yinshan Block. The Yanshan movement caused massive amounts of Yinshan material to move southward during the Middle-Late Jurassic. However, the barrier of the Yinshan Mountains caused Yinshan material to be deposited mainly in the eastern part of the basin.},

   abstract = {The evolution of large fluvial drainages in SE Tibet and adjacent areas reflects the degree of coupling between tectonics, erosion, and climate. Reconstruction of their spatio-temporal development provides significant constraints for our understanding of the palaeogeographic evolution of numerous blocks in this domain. The Burmese continental margin drained by the Irrawaddy River and its tributaries includes blocks of the Burma Terrane and the Mount Victoria Land (Eastern Belt of the Indo-Burman Ranges). To investigate how was this margin developed from the amalgamation of the two blocks since the midCretaceous, we present seismic profiles, sedimentary budget, sandstone petrography, bulk-rock geochemistry, and detrital apatite U-Pb ages from the margin. Our results show that provenance of the Burmese Forearc and Backarc depressions shifted from the proximal Western Myanmar Arc and equivalents within northern Burma Terrane to the northern Mogok Metamorphic Belt and Dianxi-Burman batholiths within SE Tibet during the late Paleogene. The provenance transition is synchronous with tectonic evolution of the Burma Terrane from an(a) oceanic/continental island arc setting to an active continental margin. We propose an evolved Western Pacific-type margin for the Burma Terrane, which is dominated by typical accretionary wedge, calc-alkaline island arc, and extensional forearc/backarc basins. An increase in sediment accumulation rates (SARs) in the Burmese Forearc indicates that the input from basement rocks within northern Burma Terrane (Tagaung-Myitkyina Belt) became more prominent and the Eastern Belt of the northern Indo-Burman Ranges were totally exposed in the Middle-Late Eocene. This result corroborates the Burma Terrane assembled with SE Asia (Sibumasu Terrane) before the Middle Eocene. The first presence of SE Tibet-like detritus and the diversification of SARs in the Burmese Forearc and Backarc in the Oligocene are compatible with dextral motion on the Sagaing Fault, which may have triggered the birth of the palaeo-Irrawaddy river and fluvial drainage reorganization in its upper reaches. Higher sedimentary fluxes recorded in the Burmese Forearc and Backarc depressions and the Andaman Sea during the Neogene are compatible with enhanced rock erosion within SE Tibet and thus, can be explained by rapid tectonic uplift and an intensified Asia monsoon in this region.

   abstract = {Understanding the tectonics that gave rise to the formation of Tibet is critical to our understanding of crustal deformation processes. The unusual geomorphology of the drainage basins of East Asia's major rivers has been proposed to be the result of either (1) distortion and attenuation of antecedent drainages as India indents into Asia, which can therefore be used as passive strain markers of horizontal shear, or (2) due to fragmentation by river captures and flow reversals of an originally continental-scale drainage, in which the major East Asian rivers once flowed into the palaeo-Red River. If the latter hypothesis is correct, then it has been proposed that dating the drainage fragmentation constrains the timing of uplift of Tibet. A number of sedimentary provenance studies have been undertaken in order to determine whether the palaeo-Red River was once a river of continental proportions into which the upper reaches of the Yangtze, Salween, Mekong, Irrawaddy, and Yarlung drained. We have assessed the evidence that the Yarlung originally flowed into the palaeo-Red river, and then sequentially into the Irrawaddy and Brahmaputra, connecting to the latter first via the Lohit and then the Siang. For this river system, we have integrated our new data from the Paleogene-Recent Irrawaddy drainage basin (detrital zircon U-Pb with Hf and fission track, rutile U-Pb, mica Ar-Ar, bulk rock Sr-Nd, and petrography) with previously published data, to produce a palaeodrainage model that is consistent with all datasets. In our model, the Yarlung never flowed into the Irrawaddy drainage: during the Paleogene, the Yarlung suture zone was an internally drained basin, and from Neogene times onwards the Yarlung drained into the Brahmaputra in the Bengal Basin. The Central Myanmar Basin, through which the Irrawaddy River flows today, received predominantly locally-derived detritus until the Middle Eocene, the Irrawaddy initiated as a through-going river draining the Mogok Metamorphic Belt and Bomi-Chayu granites to the north sometime in the Late Eocene to Early Oligocene, and the river was dominated by a stable MMB-dominated drainage throughout the Neogene to present day. Existing evidence does not support any connection between the Yarlung and the Red River in the past, but there is a paucity of suitable palaeo-Red River deposits with which to make a robust comparison. We argue that this limitation also precludes a robust assessment of a palaeo-connection between the Yangtze/ Salween/Mekong and the Red River; it is difficult to unequivocally interpret the recorded provenance changes as the result of specific drainage reorganisations. We highlight the palaeo-Red River deposits of the Hanoi Basin as a potential location for future research focus in view of the near-complete Cenozoic record of palaeo-Red River deposits at this location. A majority of previous studies consider that if a major continental-scale drainage ever existed at all, it fragmented early in the Cenozoic. Such a viewpoint would agree with the growing body of evidence from palaeoaltitude studies that large parts of SE Tibet were uplifted by this period. This then leads towards the intriguing question as to the mechanisms which caused the major period of river incision in the Miocene in this region.},

   abstract = {The West Junggar orogen, located in the southwestern Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB), preserves an abundant record of tectonic processes associated with the evolution of the Junggar Ocean. In this study, we use detrital zircon U-Pb age data from Ordovician to Carboniferous sandstones in the southern and central West Junggar domains, complemented by literature data, to better constrain the tectonic evolution of the southwestern CAOB. The Kekeshayi, Qiargaye, and Laba formations in the southern West Junggar domain were deposited during the Darriwilian-Sandbian, Katian-Aeronian, and Homerian-Emsian, respectively. Detrital zircon provenances of these formations display a marked shift from the southern West Junggar domain to the Paleo-Kazakhstan Continent (PKC). This suggests that the southern West Junggar intra-oceanic arc might have gradually accreted to the northern margin of the PKC prior to the Emsian, which has significantly contributed to the lateral growth of the PKC. The Carboniferous strata, Xibeikulasi, Baogutu, and Tailegula formations, in the central West Junggar domain represent a coherent sequence of volcaniclastic turbidites and were deposited in a progressively shrinking remnant oceanic basin during the Visean to Moscovian. They contain unimodal detrital zircon distributions and are derived from the local and coeval magmatic rocks in the central West Junggar domain. We propose that the final closure of the Junggar Ocean likely occurred in the end of the Late Carboniferous in response to regional amalgamation events in the southwestern CAOB, which marks the final assembly of the Kazakhstan Orocline. The central and southern West Junggar domains underwent individual evolution in the Paleozoic, and were recombined by the significant intra-continental reworking along the large-scale strike-slip faults.},

   title = {Paleocene initial indentation and early growth of the Pamir as recorded in the western Tarim Basin},
   journal = {Tectonophysics},
   volume = {772},
   abstract = {It is presently unclear as to when and how the Pamir were uplifted to their current elevation, because a Cenozoic sedimentary record is lacking on the Pamir Plateau, and the Pamir domes only record metamorphism associated with crustal shortening since similar to 37 Ma. Studies of the tectonic and geomorphological evolution of the Pamir in the early stages of the India Asia continental collision are also lacking. The western Tarim Basin at the northeastern margin of the Pamir provides an ideal opportunity to investigate their formation and evolution. Four Cretaceous-Paleogene stratigraphic sections were examined in this study. From these, we infer that the West Kunlun Mountains were topographic highs during the Mesozoic that divided the adjacent Central Pamir-Tianshuihai terrane from the Tarim Basin. This paleo-topographic configuration lasted until a marine transgression occurred in the Aksai Chin and Central Pamir areas in the latest Cretaceous. Provenance analysis indicates that sediments in the western Tarim Basin were derived solely from the West Kunlun Mountains until the Paleocene. The appearance of Pamir-derived detrital zircons in Paleocene and Eocene strata of the Tarim Basin suggests that the Pamir was experiencing uplift and reached an elevation similar to, or even higher, than the West Kunlun Mountains. At that time, the sandstone composition documents a provenance change from a stable continental block to an active thrust belt of the proto-West Kunlun Mountains, indicating that the western Tarim Basin evolved from an intraplate to a foreland basin setting. During the Paleocene, alluvial fan conglomerates were deposited along the northeastern margin of the Pamir, and a thick gypsum unit began to be deposited in the Tarim Basin. All these lines of evidence indicate that the north-verging thrusting, foreland basin subsidence, uplift, and northward indentation of the Pamir began in the Paleocene (62-58 Ma).},

   abstract = {The Precambrian-Palaeozoic evolution of the Qilian orogen is widely debated due to the complexity of the orogen's structure and the extent of Phanerozoic deformation. In order to identify the tectono-magmatic events of the Qilian orogenic belt, we conducted detrital zircon U-Pb geochronology on river sediments across the orogen. The results indicate that the detrital zircon ages mainly comprise five populations: 220-280 Ma, 400-520 Ma, 800-1000 Ma, 1200-2100 Ma, and 2200-2700 Ma. The sediments in the Central Qilian Block exhibit zircon age peaks at similar to 1.8 Ga and similar to 1.0 Ga, which support that the Central Qilian Block successively accreted to the Columbia and Rodinia supercontinents. The sediments in the Quanji Block exhibit zircon age peaks at similar to 1.8 Ga and similar to 2.5 Ga, revealing possible affinity of the Quanji Block to the North China Craton prior to the Neoproterozoic. The detrital zircon age population in 400-520 Ma of all the sediments recorded the continental aggregation process among the Quanji, Qaidam, and Central Qilian Blocks. The widespread 200-300 Ma zircon ages in Central Qilian, Quanji, and North Qaidam regions, reflect a tectono-magmatic event which was most likely associated with the low-angle Paleo-Tethys subduction at the southern margin of Qaidam Block. Our results underline that the overlooked Neoarchean to Paleoproterozoic and Permian to Triassic tectono-magmatic events of the Qilian orogenic belt deserves more attention in the future study. The detrital zircon age populations of different river sand samples indicate fairly high variability, highlighting that caution should be exercised while using modern river sand detrital zircon age signatures to track tectono-magmatic history of such complex orogens.},

   abstract = {The Khanka Massif, as the easternmost micro-massif of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt, its tectonic attributes and Paleozoic tectonic evolution remain controversial. In this paper, we present detrital zircon U-Pb age data for sedimentary rocks from the Huangsong Group, in order to provide constraints in this regard. The Huangsong Group has previously been described as the Precambrian basement of the Khanka Massif, consists of slightly metamorphosed sedimentary rocks, and from bottom to top is divided into the Yangmu and Yanwangdian suites. Unexpectedly, the depositional ages of the Yangmu suite are (from bottom to top) 220-205 Ma, 249-239 Ma, and 509-485 Ma. The depositional ages of the Yanwangdian suite are (from bottom to top) 426-390 Ma and 232-220 Ma. Clearly, the rocks do not have a logical stratigraphic sequence and, therefore, we propose that the "Huangsong Group" represents a stack of tectonic terrains with diverse ages (early Paleozoic to early Mesozoic) rather than a continuous sedimentary sequence. The potential sediment sources were mainly a nearby magmatic arc and batholiths, because the zircons are euhedral-subhedral, exhibit well-developed oscillatory zoning, and have high Th/U ratios. The occurrence of Precambrian detrital zircon grains implies the existence of remnants of Precambrian basement along the western margin of the Khanka Massif in the early Paleozoic. A comparison of magmatism in the regional massifs revealed there was a tectonic affinity between the western margin of the Khanka Massif and eastern margin of the Songnen-Zhangguangcai Range Massif in the Paleozoic. Based on the detrital zircon age populations and trace element contents, we conclude that the western Khanka Massif experienced a change from a stable to an active margin setting during the late Paleozoic, which was caused by subduction of the Paleo-Asian oceanic lithosphere.

   abstract = {The Triassic strata in the Turpan-Hami Basin potentially chronicled the missing sedimentary record of Indosinian tectonic evolution in the Eastern Tianshan. In this study, we conducted detrital zircon U-Pb geochronological analyses on subsurface Triassic samples collected from the Turpan-Hami Basin to unravel sedimentary response of Indosinian tectonic reactivation and its geodynamics. The detrital zircon age spectra of the Triassic samples are quite different, reflecting significant provenance variability. The zircon grains in the Lower Triassic sample were mainly from the Central Tianshan, while the Jueluotag acted as a minor provenance. By contrast, the Late Paleozoic rocks in Jueluotag act as the main provenance for the Middle-Upper Triassic samples, while the Central Tianshan acted as a minor provenance. Furthermore, zircon grains in the Middle Triassic sample were mainly from the Permian rocks in Jueluotag, while Indosinian strike-slip-driven rapid exhumation brought deeper Carboniferous rocks of Jueluotag as an important age population for the Upper Triassic sample. The inter-sample variability of age spectra of the Triassic samples provides sedimentary evidence for Indosinian tectonic reactivation in the Eastern Tianshan and its periphery, which could be attributed to differential exhumation of different sources driven by coeval strike-slip tectonics along deep faults. The Indosinian tectonic behavior in the Eastern Tianshan, which is characterized by partial melting of the pre-thickened crust and strike-slip deformation, acted as a far-field respond to the coeval continental accretion occurring along the southern Eurasian margin. Additionally, our new detrital zircon data, together with previously published data in the Turpan-Hami Basin, demonstrate that there are significant changes in source-to-sink system from the Permian to the Triassic, suggesting that the Permian-Triassic unconformity in the Eastern Tianshan and its periphery was generated by Late Permian-Early Triassic tectonic contraction and inversion rather than an increasingly arid climate.},

   abstract = {The Permian sedimentary rocks in the Turpan-Hami Basin are key records of the tectonic evolution in the Eastern Tianshan area, although their depositional ages and provenances remain relatively less studied. Here, we conducted detrital zircon U-Pb geochronology on subsurface samples collected from Well LN1 in the Turpan-Hami Basin to understand the depositional ages and provenances of the Permian rocks. In this study, detrital zircon U-Pb ages from the Late Carboniferous Sumuke Formation yielded a notable Permian age population with the youngest single-grain age at 282.6Ma. Compiling this result with a published dataset from the surrounding regions of the Turpan-Hami Basin, it shows that the Sumuke Formation was actually deposited in the Early Permian and the Late Carboniferous palynological assemblages within it are of recycled origin. The detrital zircon age spectra of the three Early-Middle Permian samples from Well LN1 define similar unimodal distribution, with prominent late Carboniferous age peaks and scarce Precambrian ages, further indicating that the zircon grains in these three samples should be ultimately sourced from the Jueluotag, the southern branch of the North Tianshan. Regionally, the Bogda, the northern branch of the North Tianshan, as catchment areas recorded interaction between southern and northern sources, and thus, there was a single greater Junggar-Turpan Basin during the Early-Middle Permian. During the latest Middle Permian to Late Permian, provenance shifts occurred at the Jueluotag and the southern piedmont of the Bogda, reflecting the uplift of the Central Tianshan and the Bogda and the isolation of the Junggar Basin and Turpan-Hami Basin. Integrating regional geological studies and provenance evolution trends, we suggest that the Turpan-Hami Basin and its surrounding regions were in a rift setting controlled by post-collision extension during Early-Middle Permian. By contrast, tectonic contraction and inversion occurred during the latest Middle Permian to Late Permian as a part of the intraplate orogenic process in the Tianshan, which responded to the convergence between the Songpan-Ganzi terrane and palaeo-Eurasian Plate.},

   abstract = {Recent results show that evolution of the huge Central Asian orogenic belt can be explained in terms of southwest Pacific-style accretion of arcs and microcontinents. A better understanding of the origin and evolution of arcs and microcontinents will enhance our knowledge on the evolution of the Central Asian orogenic belt. As one of the most important early Paleozoic arc systems south to the Solonker suture zone, the origin and evolution of the Bainaimiao arc belt are still not well constrained. New zircon U-Pb geochronological and geochemical results on magmatic rocks in the Bainaimiao arc belt indicate that the arc was active from 0.52 Ga to 0.42 Ga and can extend to east Siping in NE China. Zircon U-Pb geochronological results of metasedimentary rocks in the Bainaimiao arc belt indicate that they are early Paleozoic in age, not Precambrian as previously regarded. Detrital zircon analysis of metasedimentary rocks and Sr-Nd-Hf geochemical results of magmatic rocks indicate the existence of some Proterozoic basement rocks beneath the Bainaimiao arc, and it was built upon a Precambrian microcontinent that has a tectonic affinity to the Tarim or Yangtze cratons. The Bainaimiao arc is an ensialic island arc characterized by different evolution history and basement compositions from the northern North China craton. It was separated by a wide ocean from the northern North China craton during the Cambrian-Ordovician period. Successive northward subduction resulted in contraction of the ocean and final accretion of the Bainaimiao arc to the northern North China craton during the Late Silurian-earliest Devonian by arc-continent collision. Arc-continent collision could be an important mechanism for continental crustal growth and formation of the huge Central Asian orogenic belt.},

   abstract = {We reconstruct the early tectonic and depositional history of the western part of the North China Block (NCB) through a detailed sedimentological, chemostratigraphic, geochronological, and paleoenvironmental analysis of Mesoproterozoic strata of the northern Helan Mountains, northwest China. Siliciclastic strata of the Huangqikou Formation represent terrestrial and shallow marine deposits. Shallow marine dolostone of the overlying Wangquankou Formation comprise a transgressive systems tract with a spectacular variety of stromatolite morphologies, including unique sharp-peaked forms, common in Mesoproterozoic strata. The significant spatial distribution of approximately age-equivalent strata of the Wangquankou carbonate in the NCB argues against the interpretation that they represent aulacogen deposits. Mesoproterozoic strata in the field area are capped by the Cambrian Maozhuang Formation. We report a new trilobite fauna from this formation, including Solenoparia (Plesisolenoparia) ruichengensis, a diagnostic fossil of the Oryctocephalus salteri zone, Wulivan Stage, Miaolingian Series. This constrains the upper limit of the hiatus associated with the Mesoproterozoic-Cambrian unconformity and the timing of the early Paleozoic marine transgression in this area. Carbonate delta C-13 data for the Wangquankou Formation vary from -1.4 to 0.9%o. Covariance of carbon and oxygen isotope data from 30 to 49 m suggests variable diagenetic alteration during recrystallization, likely influenced by meteoric fluids. Isotope data for the rest of the section show low-amplitude variations, consistent with low variability in Mesoproterozoic strata worldwide. Detrital zircon UPb age spectra for the Mesoproterozoic and Cambrian strata show 1760-1820 Ma and 2400-2510 Ma peaks, which indicate local derivation from crystalline basement rocks in this region of the NCB. There are no reliable ages for Mesoproterozoic strata of the western margin of NCB, but our zircon data provide a maximum depositional age of similar to 1610 Ma for the Wangquankou Formation. Geochronologic data also show a consistent provenance throughout the Mesoproterozoic section, and for both Middle Cambrian and Middle Ordovician strata, which could suggest a remarkable paucity of major igneous events in this western part of the NCB over a considerable time span (approximately 1 billion years).},

   abstract = {Late Paleoproterozoic to early Neoproterozoic strata in Liao-Ji area (eastern Liaoning-southern Jilin) on the eastern margin of the North China Craton (NCC) provide a significant record of sediment provenance transition from the NCC to the Grenvillian orogeny. A >3000-m-thick sequence of fluvial, margin marine, and offshore marine sediments were preserved, including the Madaling, Baifangzi, Yongning, Diaoyutai, Nanfen and Qiaotou formations. To evaluate the relationship of Rodinia sediment delivery to this area, we synthesize 3177 geochronology data from the Liao-Ji area of which 1499 detrital zircon and 319 monazite ages from 17 sample analyses are newly reported herein. The results indicate that the Madaling, Baifangzi, Yongning, Diaoyutai (not including Dalian samples) and Nanfen Formations have two major peaks at 1.8 Ga and 2.5 Ga. The depositional ages of the formations are 1.27-0.92 Ga, as constrained by the ages of the youngest detrital zircons and later mafic intrusions. In the Madaling/Baifangzi/Yongning period, Longgang and Liaonan blocks and the late Paleoproterozoic Jiao-Liao-Ji belt were dominant in deposition. During the Diaoyutai-Nanfen period, grains derived from Mesoproterozoic rocks began to accumulate in topographically low areas, such as the Fuzhou Gulf. In the Qiaotou period, Mesoproterozoic grain-derived sources dominated the deposition. Combining the studies of late Mesoproteorozoic-early Neoperoterozoic successions from the Xuhuai and Jiaobei areas, the detrital zircon spectra in the Liao-Ji area document the transition from the initial NCC to a distant Grenvillian orogeny related provenance (Laurentia, Siberia, SF-Congo and Baltica have been excluded) from possible south/southeast.},

   abstract = {The Jiao-Liao-Ji Belt is located between the Longgang and Langrim blocks in the Eastern Block of the North China Craton (NCC). The belt comprises Palaeoproterozoic volcanic-sedimentary successions that are divided into the Ji'an, South Liaohe, and Jingshan groups in the south and the Laoling, North Liaohe and Fenzishan groups in the north. The tectonic setting and depositional environments of the Liao-Ji area are debated. This paper presents geochemical and detrital zircon U-Pb data for the boron-bearing, graphite-bearing, aluminumrich Ji'an Group and the elastic sediments and carbonates of the Laoling Group in southern Jilin Province, in order to constrain their depositional ages, provenance and tectonic setting. Zircon geochronology for both the Ji'an and Laoling groups yields age peaks of 2.57-2.41, 2.23-2.09, and 2.04-2.02 Ga, indicating that the sediments were derived from the Longgang and/or Liaonan block(s), the 2.2-2.1 Ga Liaoji granitoids and similar to 2.0 Ga igneous rocks, respectively. On the basis of the youngest detrital zircons and the oldest metamorphic zircon peaks, depositional ages can be constrained to the period of 2.13-1.94, 2.10-1.94, and 1.95-1.90 Ga for the Mayihe, Huangchagou, and Dadongcha formations of the Ji'an Group, and 2.18-1.90, 2.08-1.91, 1.99-1.90, 1.96-1.90, and 1.94-1.90 Ga for the Dataishan, Zhenzhumen, Huashan, Linjiang, and Dalizi formations of the Laoling Group, respectively. The zircon age spectra of each formation indicate that deposition of the Ji'an and Laoling groups was related to the opening and closing of a back-arc during the period 2.2-1.9 Ga. The Dataishan Formation (Laoling Group) was deposited in the rift environment during opening of the back-arc. During the early stage, the Mayihe and Huangchagou formations (Ji'an Group) were deposited on the side of the magmatic arc, and the Zhenzhumen Formation (Laoling Group) was deposited on the passive-margin side. During the late stage, both Ji'an and Laoling groups were deposited in a pre-orogenic setting, including the Dadongcha, Huashan, Linjiang and Dalizi formations. Detrital zircon age spectra of the Ji'an Group are similar to those of the South Liaohe Group (with the exception of the Gaojiayu Formation), indicating that the two groups had a similar provenance.},

New detrital zircon U-Pb and Hf isotopic data from Sumatra, complemented by literature data, challenge the above views. The scarcity of early Neoproterozoic zircons in West Sumatra argues against a direct connection between West Sumatra and Cathaysia. Detrital zircons from East Sumatra exhibit age profiles similar to those of Lhasa, West Burma, and Western Australia, with detritus most probably sourced from Western Australia. By contrast, Sibusima (Sibumasu excluding East Sumatra) shows detrital zircon age patterns resembling those of the South Qiangtang and the Tethyan and High Himalaya terranes, whose detrital materials are most likely derived from northern India. Our observations require disaggregation of Sibumasu and a new configuration of northern East Gondwana in the early Paleozoic, with East Sumatra and West Burma occupying a position outboard the Lhasa terrane along the NW Australian margin and Sibusima situated on the northern Greater Indian margin.},

   abstract = {Core SE2 from the landward part of the modem Qiantang River (QR) estuary contains a 50 + m-thick succession of late Pleistocene to Holocene deposits that records the transgressive-regressive environmental transition from fluvial sedimentation, through a paleo-estuary phase and shallow-marine deposition, to the modern estuarine setting. Sand and silt samples from the Paleo-QR estuary phase were analyzed for heavy-mineral and geochemical compositions, as well as the U-Pb ages of detrital zircons, in order to investigate the source of the sediment during the Holocene. The Paleo-QR estuary sediments in core SE2, which accumulated between approximately 10,100 and 9500 cal yr B.P., contain a characteristic heavy-mineral assemblage of hematite-limonite, epidote, zircon, leucoxene and magnetite, consistent with derivation from the QR drainage basin. These data, as well as geochemical proxies including the fractionation patterns of trace and rare earth elements, and elemental ratios La/Sc and Th/Co, suggest that the Paleo-QR estuary sediments cannot be derived from the modern Changjiang River to the north, which is contributing to the infill of the present-day QR estuary. Two major zircon-grain age peaks (99-250 Ma and 740-1000 Ma) coincide with the main tectonic and magmatic events in the QR catchment, whereas the characteristic age peaks for the modern Changjiang River sediments (e.g. 200-400 Ma and 1800-2100 Ma) are absent. Because the portion of the Paleo-QR estuary sampled is interpreted to lie seaward of the contemporaneous bedload convergence, in the area experiencing flood-dominant, landward transport of sediment, the sand and silt are unlikely to have come directly from the QR. Instead, we infer that the sediments were derived from the offshore part of the QR incised valley by flood-tidal reworking and landward transport. During the Paleo-QR estuary period, the incised valleys of the QR and Changjiang River were separate from each other for a considerable distance offshore. Sediment supplied by the Changjiang River was trapped in its estuary such that there was no sediment exchange between the two systems as there is now. This case study indicates that the combination of sediment geochemistry, heavy-mineral composition, and zircon chronology can supply important constraints on sediment dispersal patterns, even in dynamic estuarine and coastal areas with complex sediment transport pathways.

   abstract = {The timing of the establishment of the Yangtze River, whether prior to the early Miocene (similar to 24 Ma) or more recently (similar to 2 Ma), has been a point of much debate. Here we applied detrital zircon U-Pb dating to Miocene sedimentary rocks from Taiwan and to estuary sands from modern rivers in SE China to trace sediment provenance and to further constrain the evolution of the Yangtze River. Detrital zircon U-Pb ages from Miocene sandstones of the Western Foothills show similar age spectra to Miocene and modern sediments in the Yangtze River drainage and some similarity to the Minjiang River sediments. However, they differ significantly from ages in some sandstones from the Hengchun Peninsula accretionary prism and from the estuary sands of the Jiulongjiang River. This information, together with petrographic and sedimentary facies analysis, argues that the Jiulongjiang and Minjiang Rivers were major sources to some Hengchun Peninsula turbidites (similar to 12 Ma), while synchronous sedimentation in the Western Foothills was supplied from the Yangtze, Minjiang (or similar river), and possibly even the Yellow River. These sediments were transported southward/eastward via rivers or channels to the marginal sedimentary basins now inverted in the Western Foothills in Taiwan. The Yangtze River must have been established prior to the middle Miocene.},

   abstract = {We conducted petrographic, geochemical, and new U-Pb laser ablation inductively coupled mass spectrometry analyses of detrital zircons in the sandstone samples from the important Mengqiguer sandstone-type uranium deposit located in the Yili basin of the Xishanyao Formation. This formation (Shuixigou Group) is a major uranium-bearing target stratum in the basin. The main purpose of our investigations was to determine the provenance of the host sand units that has remained unclear to date. Our petrographic results suggested that the host sandstone is texturally and chemically immature, indicating superior physicochemical conditions for later uranium mineralisation. The major and trace element data of the detrital sandstone samples point towards the upper continental crust, and the chondrite-normalised rare earth element (REE) plots show enriched light REE and relatively flat heavy-REE distribution, with a negative Eu anomaly. The characteristics of the REEs and the trace elements point to felsic rocks as the provenance of the target strata with a continental arc tectonic setting. The detrital zircons indicate an age span of similar to 235-similar to 2327 Ma, with major age populations of similar to 300-similar to 500 Ma. The increasing amount of zircon grains from the Late Devonian to the Early Carboniferous coinciding with the age of volcanic magmatic activities of the Wusun and Nalati mountains indicates that the rocks formed under the Tianshan collisional orogeny and the subsequent extensional environment.},

   abstract = {Petrographic analysis, detrital zircon U-Pb geochronology and Neodymium isotope are applied to the Middle-Late Miocene turbidite sequences in the Hengchun accretionary prism, southern Taiwan, to constrain the provenance and nature of sedimentation in the Manila subduction system. Both petrographic study and detrital zircon U-Pb ages show that the Middle-Late Miocene turbidite sequences were primarily derived from Mesozoic granites and volcanic rocks of the Cathaysian Block in SE China, which were transported southeastward via rivers like Minjiang and jiulongjiang to the Taiwan area. This conclusion is further supported by Nd isotope analyses of shales intercalated within sandstone sequences showing negative epsilon Nd values (-13.3 to -10.5) of a continental origin. During the Late Miocene when global sea-level fell significantly, the SE China coastline shifted seaward to the eastern part of the present Taiwan Strait, which would have facilitated these continent-derived sediments being transported southeastward to the shelf-upper slope of the Chinese continental margin. These turbidite sequences were then deformed and accreted into the accretionary prism of the Hengchun Peninsula when the South China Sea oceanic lithosphere subducted eastward beneath the Philippine Sea Plate in the Late Miocene. Our study suggests that sedimentary deposition of the turbidite sequences in the Hengchun Peninsula could be strongly controlled by different river system supply, submarine channeling transport and fluctuations of sea-level.

   abstract = {As a major Precambrian microcontinent in the southernmost Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB), the Central Tianshan block (CTS) in the Chinese Tianshan is essential for understanding the final assembly of the southern CAOB. It experienced multistage Paleozoic magmatism and metamorphism, but the detailed processes are still controversial and far from being completely understood. This paper reports coupled U-Pb and Lu-Hf isotopic data of detrital zircons from late Paleozoic (meta-)sedimentary strata in the South Tianshan belt, which can provide new insight into deciphering the Paleozoic evolution of the eastern segment of the CTS block. Characterized by typical oscillatory zoning and high Th/U ratios (>0.2), detrital zircons in the Permian sedimentary samples yield dominant age populations at ca. 505-490 Ma, 475-440 Ma, 430-400 Ma and 340-250 Ma, pinpointing the development of four episodes of magmatism in the eastern CTS block. Particularly, Ordovician-Silurian (475-440 Ma) zircons, possessing low negative epsilon(Hf)(t) values, predominate in sedimentary strata in and surrounding the CTS block, indicating that the 475-440 Ma magmatic rocks probably constitute the main body of the CTS block. The origin of this (early Paleozoic) episode of magmatism was most likely related to the southward subduction of the Junggar Ocean beneath the CTS block. Carboniferous-Triassic (340-250 Ma) zircons have dominantly positive epsilon(Hf)(t) values, probably derived from the post-collisional juvenile rocks in the CTS block. Combined with previous studies, our data suggest that the single source terrane for the sampled strata was the CTS block, which had been a topographic high providing substantial detritus to the surrounding areas at least since the Early Permian. In the metasedimentary sample, detrital zircons mostly show partially/fully recrystallized internal textures and low Th/U ratios (<0.2), probably sourced from the amphibolite- to granulite-facies metamorphosed rocks in the eastern CTS block. The youngest zircons suggest that the sampled metasedimentary strata were Carboniferous (341-305 Ma) in age, rather than Neoproterozoic (or Early Sinian in Chinese literatures) as previously interpreted. Based on U-Pb-Hf isotopes and Ti-in-zircon thermometer of metamorphic zircons in this study, as well as previous investigations, we suggest that the eastern CTS block has experienced (a) a 400-370 Ma collisional event, related to the closure of the eastern segment of the South Tianshan Ocean, and (b) a 360-340 Ma extensional event, as a result of post-collisional mantle upwelling, Therefore, the final assembly of the Eastern Tianshan took place during Late Carboniferous time.

   abstract = {The thick Silurian siliciclastic sedimentary rocks in the Qin-Fang region contrasting with their absence in surrounding regions have long been an enigma for the early Paleozoic geology of South China. Here we employ detrital zircon U-Pb geochronology and Lu-Hf isotope analysis of Cambrian to Devonian samples from the Qin-Fang and adjacent regions to trace sedimentary provenance and to further constrain its tectonic setting. The similar age spectra of the Cambrian samples from both sides of the Qin-Fang region imply that they should be derived from a common source(s), arguing against the presence of a Cambrian ocean in the Qin-Fang region. However, the U-Pb age patterns of these Cambrian samples, as well as from Silurian and Ordovician sandstones both from within and outside the Qin-Fang region, differ significantly from those of a middle Devonian sample from the Qin-Fang region, and Ordovician to upper Triassic samples from the Indochina Block. These results, in conjunction with regional geological information, indicate that the Yunkai Mountain, which is located adjacent to the Qin-Fang region, must have been emerged above sea level in the middle Devonian. Meanwhile, it can also imply that the Qin-Fang region should be a part of South China rather than being a segment of the Indochina Block. A two-stage evolutionary history of the Qin-Fang region is proposed, (1) an intracontinental basin mainly filled by materials eroded from east Gondwana and/or eastern Cathaysia Block during the early Paleozoic and (2) a foreland basin in the Yunkai Mountain region at least since the middle Devonian.
Whether there was an ocean existed in the Qin-Fang region, southern South China and what is its plate tectonic affiliation have long been an enigma for the early Paleozoic geology of South China. This study can tell us that the Qin-Fang region, without an ocean developed during the early Paleozoic, is a part of South China rather than being a segment of the Indochina Block. Sediments in the Qin-Fang region were mainly sourced from east Gondwana and/or eastern Cathaysia Block during the Silurian, and then transformed to receive massive materials from the Yunkai Domain since the middle Devonian.},

We applied detrital zircon U-Pb dating to Permian-Triassic sedimentary rocks from South China to trace sediment provenance and to further test these models. Our results, combined with other published data from the Pingxiang, Youjiang, Yong'an, and Yongding Basins, show that 400-350 Ma and 300-260 Ma zircon grains are ubiquitous throughout the entirety of southern South China. This indicates regional magmatic events as potential sources. The discovery of Middle-Late Devonian and Early Permian igneous rocks, tuffs, and volcaniclastic rocks in Southeast Asia and Hainan Island implies the presence of two magmatic events (400-350 Ma and 300-260 Ma) within or beyond the southern margin of South China. This information, together with the mostly negative epsilon(Hf)(t) values of 400-350 Ma and 300-260 Ma zircon grains, arc-like geochemical signatures of the possible source rocks, and the regional geology of East Asia, suggests that they originated from sources related to Paleotethyan and even Proto-Tethyan subduction. Thus, Permian-Triassic sedimentation and the Indosinian orogeny in South China were largely controlled by the evolution of the Tethyan Ocean.},

We employ multiple methods, which includes sandstone petrography, detrital garnet composition and detrital zircon U-Pb dating to investigate the likely sources of these terrigenous deposits and to reconstruct the paleogeographic link between the proto-Japan and the East Asian continent. The highly immature Late Permian sandstones are interpreted to derive from multi-type source rocks that include felsic igneous rocks, basalts, sedimentary rocks and low to medium-grade metamorphic rocks in proximal locations. The detrital zircon U-Pb results show that all samples contain a dominant Early to Late Permian zircon population (294-254 Ma) and these zircons are interpreted to be derived from an active volcanic arc, which was most likely caused by subduction of the Paleo-Pacific plate beneath the South China Block. We found that spessartine-rich almandine garnets and almandine garnets dominated assemblages in the lower unit changed to grossular-andradite garnets dominated assemblage in the upper unit, which was caused by a progressive uplifting and denudation of the Permian volcanic arc.},

Argoland, a continental fragment that rifted from NW Australia during the Late Jurassic, played a key role in the initial opening of the Indian Ocean and the evolution of eastern Tethys. However, its present identity remains elusive, with East Java-West Sulawesi currently assumed to be the most likely option. To constrain the missing Argoland and its role in India-Asia convergence, we report new detrital zircon data from Sulawesi, Indonesia, and West Burma, Myanmar, and synthesize literature results from relevant regions in Southeast Asia, which (>15,000) reveal age profiles of West Sulawesi, the central Sulawesi metamorphic belt, and southeast Borneo comparable to that of Bird's Head, New Guinea, whereas age patterns of West Burma and East/West Java are similar to those of NW Australia. Notably, the most dominant age populations in NW Australia are rarely detected in Sulawesi and Borneo. These observations, combined with previous geological records and recent paleomagnetic data, suggest that West Burma is the mysterious Argoland, opposing the currently favored East Java-West Sulawesi model, with East Java and West Sulawesi probably having originated from NW Australia and Bird's Head, respectively. We estimate an average northward motion of -6-8 cm/yr for West Burma, which split from NW Australia to approach the equator during ca. 155-95 Ma, shedding new light on the reconstruction and breakup of northern East Gondwana, progressive building of Southeast Asia, and India-Asia convergence.},

In this paper, we present detrital zircon U-Pb ages from sediments from Core LYH drilled in the northern margin of the basin. We use these to illuminate changing sediment transport processes, provenance and palaeo-environments during the Quaternary. The sediments are dominated by zircon age groups of 100-400 Ma and 400-550 Ma, and three secondary age peaks at 700-1100 Ma, 1700-2100 Ma and 2400-2600 Ma. Multidimensional scaling plots support the conclusion that the Central Loess Plateau and the Luo River are the dominant sources of sediments to the core site. Before c. 1.06 Ma, the Qinling Mountains and the Wei River, as well as the Yellow River, had minor influence on the sedimentation at the core site. These results are consistent with the existence of a palaeolake prior to 1.06 Ma, which allowed sediments supplied to the south and east edge of the basin to be reworked to the northern side of the Weihe Basin. Subsequently, the Luo River has provided a steady source of sediments to the northern Weihe Basin.},

   abstract = {The Imjingang Belt in the Korean Peninsula (KP) attracts much attention because of its critical position in determining the tectonic affiliation of the peninsula. The key to clarifying current controversy lies in the understudied Archaean-Proterozoic basement rocks and Devonian- Carboniferous sedimentary series (i.e.,Imjin Group) in the North Korean part of the belt. In this study, we present geochronological study on magmatic zircons in three Paleoproterozoic gneissic granites and detrital zircons in four clastic rocks of the Imjin Group. SIMS U-Pb zircon analyses on the former reveal that three gneissic granites formed at 1884 +/- 10 Ma, 1875 +/- 10 Ma and 1885 +/- 10 Ma, respectively. They are reminiscent of similarly aged granitic magmatism from the North China Craton (NCC) and in the Nangrim, Gyeonggi and Yeongnam massifs of the KP, thus defining a consistent Paleoproterozoic granitic magmatic event across the NCC and the KP. Detrital zircons from the Puap Formation of the Imjin Group yield age populations of 2.5-23 Ga (similar to 19%), 2.1-1.5 Ga (similar to 15%), 1424-1176 Ma (similar to 9%), 1108-676 Ma (similar to 31%) and 591-388 Ma (similar to 26%). The youngest group gives a weighted mean Pb-206/U-238 age of 401 +/- 3 Ma (n = 15), confirming a depositional age of younger than 400 Ma for the Puap Formation. Together with typical Middle Devonian Givetian and Upper Devonian Famennian standard fossil assemblage in the formation, we constrain the formation to be of Late Devonian. The Puap and Misan formations in the Imjingang Belt show consistent detrital zircon age spectra with those of representative Paleozoic sequences in the Pyongnam and Taebaeksan basins of the KP and the Paleozoic basins in the NCC, implying that the NCC and KP might share congruous tectonic history in the Paleozoic. This can lead to further inferences that the Nangrim and Gyeonggi massifs were connected at least before Late Devonian and that the Imjingang Belt might not be the eastward extension of the Qinling-Dabie-Sulu collisional belt.

   abstract = {Paleogeographic reconstructions of terranes can greatly benefit from the provenance analysis of sediments. A series of Cenozoic basins provide key sedimentary archives for investigating the growth of the Tibetan Plateau, yet the provenance of the sediments in these basins has never been constrained robustly. Here we report sedimentary petrological and detrital zircon geochronological data from the Paleocene-Eocene Nangqian-Xialaxiu and Gongjue basins. Sandstone detrital modes and zircon morphology suggest that the samples collected in these two basins were sourced from recycled orogen. Detrital zircon geochronology indicates that sediments in the Nangqian-Xialaxiu Basin are characterized by two distinct age populations at 220-280 Ma and 405-445 Ma. In contrast, three predominant age populations of 207-256 Ma, 423-445 Ma, and 1851-1868 Ma, and two subordinate age populations of similar to 50 Ma and similar to 2500 Ma, are recognized in the Gongjue Basin. Comparison with detrital zircon ages from the surrounding terranes suggests that sediments in the Nangqian-Xialaxiu Basin come from the neighboring thrust belts, whereas sediments from the Gongjue Basin are predominantly derived from the distant Songpan-Ganzi Terrane with minor contribution from the surrounding areas. A three-stage Cenozoic evolution of the eastern Tibetan Plateau is proposed. During the Paleocene, the Nangqian-Xialaxiu Basin appeared as a set of small intermontane sub-basins and received plentiful sediments from the neighboring mountain belts; during the Eocene, the Gongjue Basin kept a relatively low altitude and was a depression at the edge of a proto-Plateau; since the Oligocene, the Tibetan Plateau further uplifted and the marginal Gongjue Basin was involved in the Tibetan interior orogeny, indicating the eastward propagation of the Tibetan Plateau.},

   abstract = {In this article, we present in situ U-Pb and Lu-Hf isotope data for Upper Triassic detritus in the Sichuan region of northwestern South China, which was a foreland basin during the Late Triassic. The aim is to determine the provenance of sediments in the foreland basin and to constrain the evolution of the surrounding mountain belts. U-Pb age data for the Late Triassic detrital zircons generally show populations at 2.4-2.6Ga, 1.7-1.9Ga, 710-860Ma, 410-460Ma, and 210-300Ma. By fitting the zircon data into the tectonic, sedimentologic, and palaeographic framework, we propose that the north Yangtze Block and South Qinling-Dabie Orogen were the important source areas of sediments in the northern part of the foreland basin, whereas the Longmen Shan thrust-fold belt was the main source region for detritus in other parts of the foreland basin. The South Qinling-Dabie Orogen could also have served as a physical barrier to block most detritus shed from the southern North China Block into the foreland basin during the sedimentation of the Xujiahe Formation. Our results also reveal that part of the flysch from the eastern margin of the Songpan-Ganzi region had been displaced into the Longmen Shan thrust-fold belt before the deposition of the foreland basin sediments. In addition, the Lu-Hf data indicate that Phanerozoic igneous rocks in central China show insignificant formation of the juvenile crust.},

The results show five major age groups: 3.1-2.0, 1.8-1.4, 1.4-0.8, 0.6-0.4, and similar to 0.26 Ga. Archean to Neoproterozoic zircons were derived from the central Qilian belt. The early Paleozoic grains are considered to have been derived from the magmatic arc related to ocean closure. The youngest age may be derived from the recycling of sediments prior to the Nanyinger Group. The youngest detrital zircon age (262 +/- 5 Ma) is close to the depositional age of the strata, suggesting rapid uplift of the Qilian Mountains. In the early Indosinian, the palaeo-Qilian Mountains uplifted rapidly and provided the main source for the Hexi Corridor basins. The North Qilian Belt is the southern boundary of the Hexi Corridor basins. From the Ordovician to the Triassic, the depocenter gradually moved to the Qilian Mountains and was very close to the Qilian Mountains in the Late Triassic. By comparing with previous research, we infer that the Hexi Corridor basin may not connect with the Ordos Basin in the Triassic.},

   abstract = {The early Neoproterozoic amalgamation process of the Yangtze with Cathaysia blocks in South China is an important geoscience issue and its collisional time has attracted extensive attention during the past decades. The Linjiawan conglomerate and Yinzhuba agglomerate of the Cangshuipu Group and associated rocks along the Central Jiangnan Orogen preserved key records for better constraining the assembly process of the Yangtze with Cathaysia blocks. This study presents a set of new geochronological and geochemical data of the volcanic gravels and the associated rocks from the Lengjiaxi, Cangshuipu and Banxi groups. Our data show that the dacitic and rhyolitic gravels in the Linjiawan conglomerate give zircon U-Pb ages of 834 +/- 2 Ma and 835 +/- 6 Ma, respectively, significantly older than that (814-824 Ma) of the Yinzhuba agglomerate. The volcanic gravels in the Linjiawan conglomerate are characterized by subalkaline dacite and rhyolite, geochemically distinct from the high-mg andesite of the Yinzhuba agglomerate. Such characteristics, along with our field observations, suggest that the Yinzhuba agglomerate is conformably underlain by the Linjiawan conglomerate. The detrital zircons from the sandstones in the Lengjiaxi Group and the lower and upper parts of the Banxi Group yield the predominant early Neoproterozoic age-peaks at 863 Ma, 810 Ma and 795 Ma, respectively. The sandy gravel from the Hengluchong conglomerate at the basal Banxi Group give the youngest age-peak of 810 Ma. These data suggest that the Linjiawan and Hengluchong conglomerates represent two angular unconformities, in turn separating the Cangshuipu from Lengjiaxi (similar to 860-835 Ma) and Banxi (similar to 810-720 Ma) Groups. The unconformities were deposited at similar to 830 Ma and similar to 810 Ma, respectively, reflecting the initial collision and final assemblage of the Yangtze with Cathaysia blocks along the Central Jiangnan Orogen. The synthesis of all the available data indicates that the assemblage process of the Yangtze with Cathaysia blocks might be episodic with the collisional time of the Eastern Jiangnan Orogen being significantly earlier than that of the Central Jiangnan Orogen. An early Neoproterozoic arc-continent assembly model is herein proposed for the Jiangnan Orogen. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Here, we present the results of U-Pb dating of detrital zircons from the Ergunahe Group and the Wubinaobao Formation, within northeastern Inner Mongolia, NE China, with the aim of constraining the tectonic setting of the Erguna Massif. The majority of detrital zircons from five samples collected from the Ergunahe Group and the Wubinaobao Formation are magmatic, although some zircons have metamorphic growth rims. Zircons in two mica schists and in feldspar-quartz sandstone from the Ergunahe Group yield age populations that cluster around 738, 760, 792, 837, 890, 964, and 1050 Ma, whereas zircons from two quartz sandstones within the Wubinaobao Formation yield age populations that cluster at 466, 484, 515, 738, 795, 837, and 894 Ma. These data, combined with detrital zircon age populations (ca. 712 Ma) from the adjacent Xinghuadukou Group, and the fact that the Ergunahe Group intruded by Caledonian gabbros is overlain by upper Silurian units, indicate that the Ergunahe Group formed at 738-712 Ma (i.e. during the Neoproterozoic). In addition, the Wubinaobao Formation is subdivided into two units: a calcareous siltstone unit within the western part of the study area and a quartz sandstone within the eastern part. The calcareous siltstone formed at 712-795 Ma, similar to the Ergunahe Group, whereas the quartz sandstone formed between the 466 Ma and late Silurian. The age spectra of detrital zircons from the Ergunahe Group and the Wubinaobao Formation indicate that sediment in both of these units was derived from terranes that outcrop around the basin. The widespread occurrence of Neoproterozoic detrital zircons within both the Ergunahe Group and the Wubinaobao Formation suggests that Precambrian terranes are present within the Erguna Massif and that the massif has an affinity to the Siberian Craton.},

Our samples are characterized by a common, prominent group of Hf crust formation model ages at 0.8-4.1Ga with a peak at 2.7-3.4Ga. This fact indicates that (1) Phanerozoic magmatism in central China could have been predominantly products of crustal reworking with insignificant formation of juvenile crust and (2) the Neoarchaean was an important period of continental growth in central China. In addition, our data set also reveal that three widespread tectonothermal events could have occurred in the region during the late Mesoproterzoic, Palaeozoic, and early Mesozoic, respectively.},

Two groups of detrital zircons, i.e. magmatic and metamorphic in origin, have been identified based on cathodoluminescence images, zircon Ti-temperatures, and Th/U ratios. Our data suggest that the derivation of siliciclastic rocks in the Songpan terrane was mainly from the Qinling, Qilian, and Kunlun orogens, whereas the Yangtze and North China Cratons served as minor source areas during late Permian-Triassic times. The detrital zircons from Middle-Late Triassic siliciclastic rocks exhibit wide age spectra with two dominant populations of 230-600Ma and >1600Ma, peaking at ~1.8-1.9Ga and ~2.4-2.5Ga, suggestive of a derivation from the Qinling, Qilian, and Kunlun orogens and the Yangtze Craton being the minor source area. The proportions of detrital zircon populations from the northern Qinling, Qilian, and Kunlun orogens distinctly decreased during Middle-Late Triassic time, demonstrating that the initial uplift of the western Qinling occurred then and it could have blocked most of the detritus from the Qilian-northern Qinling orogens and North China Cratons into the main Songpan-Ganzi depositional basin. The relatively detrital zircon proportions of the Yangtze Craton source decreased during Early-Middle Late Triassic time, indicating that the Longmenshan orogen was probably being elevated, since the early Late Triassic and gradually formed a barrier between the Yangtze Craton and the Songpan terrane. In addition, our Lu-Hf isotopic results also reveal that the Phanerozoic magmatic rocks in central China had been the primary products of crustal reworking with insignificant formation of a juvenile crust.},

Late Palaeozoic and Early Mesozoic sediments deposited here may provide keys to understanding the tectonic evolution of the Palaeo-Tethys and collision of the North China and Yangtze Cratons. We conducted in situ U-Pb and Lu-Hf isotope analyses of 568 detrital zircons collected from Upper Palaeozoic to Mesozoic sandstones in the central Qinling block, Taohe depression, and Bailongjiang block in western Qinling to constrain the sources of these sandstones. Our results reveal that the Bailongjiang block has affinities with the Yangtze Craton, from which it may have been rifted. Therefore, the Palaeo-Tethyan Animaqen suture between the two cratons lies north of the Bailongjiang block. We identified the North China Craton as the main source for Triassic flysch in central China. It is possible that the Bailongjiang block could have blocked detritus shed from the North China Craton into the main depositional basins in the Songpan-Ganzi area. The dominance of 300-200 Ma detrital zircons of metamorphic origin in Lower Jurassic sandstones indicates that the Dabie-Qinling orogen was elevated during Early Jurassic time. In addition, our Lu-Hf isotopic results also reveal that Phanerozoic igneous rocks in central China were mostly products of crustal reworking with insignificant formation of juvenile crust.},

New in situ detrital zircon U-Pb and Hf isotopic analyses from a Cenozoic sedimentary sequence in SW Iran are used to unravel the amalgamation history of Neo-Tethys. Data indicate that: (1) Paleocene and Eocene strata (58 and 45 Ma, respectively) were sourced from obducted ophiolite and Triassic volcanics, (2) Lower Miocene (similar to 18 Ma) strata indicate mixed provenance from obducted ophiolite and Iranian magmatic rocks, (3) Mid to Upper Miocene sediments (similar to 14 to 11.2 Ma) were mainly sourced from Sanandaj-Sirjan zone granitoids to the north, and (4) Lower Pliocene (similar to 5 Ma) sediments mainly show Arabian age characteristics, with a minor Eurasian affinity component. Two hypotheses are outlined to highlight the key events: Hypothesis A, previously published by several workers, suggests that the sequence studied lay on the Arabia passive margin and that initial collision occurred prior to 18 Ma; Hypothesis B, modified from the Makran model, which is here preferred, suggests that Paleogene to Upper Miocene sediments were sourced from the northern Neo-Tethyan accretionary complex or Eurasia, and carry no input from Arabia, whereas the Lower Pliocene sample shows a mixed provenance from both Arabia and Eurasia, suggesting that collision occurred between similar to 11.2 and 5 Ma.},

U-Pb dating was performed on detrital zircons separated from the three sandstone samples. Detrital zircons from sample a-1 have dominant age populations of 100-110 Ma, 190-220 Ma, and similar to 1800 Ma, and sample z-1 has dominant ages of 130-150 Ma and similar to 350 Ma. This paper demonstrates that the provenance of the fourth member of the Nenjiang Formation is significantly different from the first member of the Coniacian Yaojia Formation. The provenance above the nonconformity became much more complex and the eastern source increased significantly, while the western source sharply declined. The main source areas of the fourth member of the Nenjiang Formation are mainly the Zhangguangcai Range, the eastern Lesser Xiang'an Range and the southeast of Songliao Basin. The dominant provenance of the first member of the Yaojia Formation is the northern, the central and the southern Great Xing'an Range. According to the depositional ages and combining the latest seismic stratigraphic profiles in the Songliao Basin, the tectonic inversion of the eastern Songliao Basin began between 73 Ma and 87 Ma, which differs from the previous age of 73 Ma.

   abstract = {The interval from the late Mesoproterozoic to early Neoproterozoic is generally considered as a critical time for the amalgamation of Rodinia. The location of the North China Craton (NCC) in Rodinia remains contentious and demands greater paleomagnetic constraints. A combined geochronologic and paleomagnetic study was conducted on the late Mesoproterozoic to early Neoproterozoic rocks in the eastern NCC. Three sills were dated at ca. 945 Ma and one at ca. 920 Ma through use of the zircon U-Pb secondary ion mass spectroscopy method. Paleomagnetic investigation revealed no significant discrepancy between these sills. A positive baked-contact test, secular variation test and presence of reversals together support the primary origin interpretation for the remnant magnetization. A high-quality pole at (28.2 degrees S, 141.9 degrees E, A 95 = 10.4 degrees) was thus obtained by averaging our new results and a virtual geomagnetic pole previously reported for a ca. 920 Ma sill in the region. These Neoproterozoic sills intruded the successions that contain correlative strata that are named Nanfen, Xinxing, and Liulaobei formations in Liaoning, Jiangsu, and Anhui provinces, respectively. The Nanfen Formation and its equivalents are constrained between ca. 1120 and ca. 945 Ma by detrital zircons and the well-dated mafic sills. The paleomagnetic inclinations observed from the lower parts of the Nanfen, Xinxing, and Liulaobei formations are notably steep. The corresponding poles from these rock units are consistent and averaged at 38.6 degrees N, 136.7 degrees E (A(95) = 3.2 degrees). The quality of this pole is strengthened by a positive reversal test and its distinctiveness from the younger poles of the NCC. In the middle part of the Nanfen Formation, however, the paleomagnetic directions are characterized by moderate inclinations, being significantly different from those in the lower part of the Nanfen Formation and its equivalents. The calculated pole for the upper part of the Lower Member of the Nanfen Formation is at 8.0 degrees N, 128.5 degrees E (A(95) = 7.9 degrees). Another pole obtained from the Middle Member of the Nanfen Formation is at 11.2 degrees S, 127.7 degrees E (A(95) = 8.5 degrees). These two poles also differ from the younger poles of the NCC and likely represent the primary remanences. Our new results, together with the existing global paleomagnetic data and geological evidence, aided by the "right-way-up" connection model between Laurentia and Baltica in Rodinia, support a NCC-NW Laurentia connection between ca. 1120 and 890 Ma.},

   abstract = {The Bayanhot Basin is a superimposed basin that experienced multiple-staged tectonic movements; it is in the eastern Alxa Block, adjacent to the North China Craton (NCC) and the North Qilian Orogenic Belt (NQOB). There arewell-developed Paleozoic-Cenozoic strata in this basin, and these provide a crucialwindowto a greater understanding of the amalgamation process and source-to-sink relationships between the Alxa Block and surrounding tectonic units. However, due to intensive post-depositional modification, and lack of subsurface data, several fundamental issues-including the distribution and evolution of the depositional systems, provenance supplies and source-to-sink relationships during the Carboniferous-Permian remain unclear and thus hinder hydrocarbon exploration and limit the geological understanding of this basin. Employing integrated outcrop surveys, new drilling data, and detrital zircon dating, this study examines the paleogeographic distribution and evolution, and provenance characteristics of the Carboniferous-Permian strata in the Bayanhot Basin. Our results show that the Bayanhot Basin experienced a long-termdepositional evolution process fromtransgression to retrogression during the Carboniferous-late Permian. The transgression extent could reach the central basin in the early Carboniferous. The maximum regional transgression occurred in the early Permian and might connect the Qilian and North China seaswith each other. Subsequently, a gradual regression followed until the end of the Permian. The northwestern NCC appeared as a paleo-uplift area and served as a sediments provenance area for the Alxa Block at that time. The NCC, BayanwulaMountain, andNQOB jointly served as major provenances during the Carboniferous-Permian. There was no ocean separation, nor was there an orogenic belt between the Alxa Block and the NCC that provided sediments for both sides during the Carboniferous-Permian. The accretion of the Alxa and North China blocks should have been completed before the Carboniferous period. (C) 2021 China University of Geosciences (Beijing) and Peking University.

   abstract = {The Proto-Tethys Ocean existed from the Neoproterozoic through early Paleozoic during the breakup of Rodinia and was closed with the subduction and accretion of numerous East Asian blocks. The North Qinling Orogenic Belt is thought to have formed upon the closure of the Kuanping Ocean between the North China Craton and the Qinling Block. However, the timing of this closure is widely debated between Neoproterozoic and Paleozoic. To date, this controversy remains as a barrier in understanding the ocean-continent configuration and closure process of the Proto-Tethys Ocean. The Kuanping Ocean is best represented by the Kuanping Complex, which is the northernmost unit in the North Qinling Orogenic Belt and consists of a wide range of meta-sedimentary rocks. Here we present a systematic study of the petrology, whole-rock geochemistry and geochronology of paraschists from the complex. The paraschists yield new detrital zircon U-Pb ages from 500 Ma to 3584 Ma with two main peaks at 798 Ma and 958 Ma and a less dominant peak at 2460 Ma. Based on our investigations we infer that the protoliths of the paraschists were dominantly wackes and minor litharenites and shales with maximum depositional ages from 578 to 500 Ma, which represents different levels of a sedimentary sequence in an arc-related basin. Their clastic input was sourced mainly from the Qinling Block, with minor addditions from the North China Craton. Combining our results with previous data, we also infer that the Kuanping Complex represents an early Paleozoic accretionary wedge assemblage with existence of late Paleoproterozoic to early Neoproterozoic continental nuclei. Initial intra-oceanic subduction in the Erlangping-Kuanping Ocean occurred at ca. 578 Ma with a northward subduction polarity towards the continental nuclei, resulting in the formation of the Erlangping island arc and the protoliths of meta-sedimentary rocks in the Kuanping Complex in an arc-related basin until ca. 500 Ma. During the accretion of the Erlangping arc and the Kuanping Complex, oceanic crust subducted underneath this continental amalgam at 500-490 Ma. Northward continental subduction of the Qinling Block beneath the consolidated Erlangping-Kuanping arc terrane at 490-460 Ma and their final accretion to the southern margin of the North China Craton at ca. 440 Ma marked the closure of the northern branch of the ProtoTethys Ocean. However, sedimentation continued in few of the remaining residual oceanic basins until 436 Ma. Our new model suggests that the Erlangping-Kuanping Ocean was part of the northern branch of the Proto-Tethys Ocean and closed in the early Paleozoic with a northward subduction polarity.},

   abstract = {The Meso-Neoprotemzoic Rodinia supercontinent formed a coherent large landmass, which was later dispersed over all current major continents and a number of microcontinents. The Qinling block is a Precambrian continental mass, located in the Qinling orogenic belt, which marks the junction of the North China and South China cratons. In this paper, we present a systematic study of the petrology, whole-rock geochemistry and geochronology of metasedimentary rocks from the Xiahe Group, which is a key unit of the Precambrian basement in the Qinling block, to constrain the paleogeographic reconstruction of Rodinia. The studied meta-sedimentary rocks have detrital zircon ages of 3054-1082 Ma that peak at 1172 Ma and 1582 Ma. The protoliths of the metasedimentary rocks are mainly shales and wackes with maximum depositional ages from 1147 to 1082 Ma, representing a part of a continental arc-related sedimentary sequence. Combining our results with existing data, we propose that their pmtoliths constituted a sedimentary series including an older sequence of basement and a younger sequence with depositional ages between 1262 and 840 Ma. The detritus that is older than 1266 Ma was sourced from the continental margin of the Indian craton, which was part of the Columbia supercontinent. There was a Paleo-Mesoprotemzoic continental nucleus in the Qinling block that split from the margin of the Indian craton during the breakup of Columbia. The source rocks for the younger detritus were arc magmatic rocks in the Qinling block, which formed in a continental arc by oceanic lithosphere subduction during the assembly of Rodinia. A sequence of oceanic subduction beneath the continental nucleus of the Qinling block (1262-981 Ma), arc-continent collision between the continental nucleus and the Indian craton (981-911 Ma), continuous subduction of oceanic crust beneath the block with formation of a mature volcanic arc (929-833 Ma), and continental rifting (833-774 Ma) during the formation of the Qinling block was identified. The block faced the Neoproterozoic ocean during the assembly of Rodinia, and finally rifted off the supercontinent during its breakup to form an isolated arc terrane},

   abstract = {The Chencai terrane in the northeastern Cathaysia Block forms part of the northeast extension of the Paleozoic orogeny in South China. Recent field investigations have revealed the occurrence of high grade rocks in this terrane including granulite fades metapelites (khondalites) and orthopyroxene-bearing granulites. However, the thermal gradients and metamorphic history of this region have not been well constrained, thus impeding a better understanding of the geodynamic history of the Paleozoic orogeny in South China. Here we report results from a systematic study on the metamorphic PT conditions and geochronology of the orthopyroxene granulites and metasedimentary rocks (metapelites) from the Chencai area. The orthopyroxene granulites preserve granulite facies peak assemblage of Opx + Grt + Pl + Kfs + Qtz and a retrograde P-T trajectory. Peak PT conditions are 845860 degrees C and 0.83-0.86 Gpa, corresponding to a thermal gradient of similar to 30 degrees C/km which is much hotter than the normal thermal gradient of continental crust. Mineral compositions of the metasedimentary rocks re-equilibrated during retrograde metamorphism so that the peak PT conditions recorded by these rocks are much lower than those obtained from the orthopyroxene granulite. Peak PT conditions are 710-720 degrees C, 0.57-0.58 Gpa for garnet-biotite gneiss and 760-780 degrees C, 0.60-0.62 Gpa for biotite gametite. Zircon U-Pb dating shows that this episode of granulite facies metamorphism occurred at 430-450 Ma and the detrital population shows minor or no contribution from the basement rocks of the Cathaysia Block. The Neoproterozoic rocks occurring along the Jiangnan belt are considered to have provided the sedimentary source as indicated by the two main age peaks of 0.79 Ga and 0.83 Ga from the detrital zircon cores. Lu-Hf isotope data on the zircons indicates extensive alteration and little new zircon growth during the Paleozoic metamorphism. The epsilon(Hf)(t) values and model ages (T-DM1) of zircons suggest that the source rocks involved juvenile crustal components with Hf model ages of 1.1-1.5 Ga. Sedimentation of such a continental shelf sequence as well as the high thermal gradient of similar to 30 degrees C/km confirm the previously proposed continental arc formation and maturation model in the Chencai region.

   abstract = {The Late Mesozoic to Cenozoic evolution of Northeast Asia involves successive subduction of the Pacific oceanic crust and amalgamation of the Eurasia, North American, and Okhotsk Sea Plates. The timing of plate collision is essential for understanding the tectonic evolution of Northeast Asia. In this study, we focus on the Okhotsk Sea Plate collision with the Eurasia Plate along the Sakhalin Island, Russian Far East, which is a highly controversial problem, especially about the timing of collision. In order to determine exact timing for this collision, we report zircon U-Pb data from both the East Sakhalin accretionary complex and postcollisional granitic plutons in the Sakhalin Island. Detrital zircon data from four metasedimentary rocks show that the Sikhote-Alin orogenic belt is the main provenance for the East Sakhalin accretionary complex. Meanwhile, the youngest detrital zircon age constrains the maximum depositional age of East Sakhalin accretionary complex later than 49Ma. Both Langeri and Val'za plutons are made of peraluminous S-type granite. Four granitic samples yielded consistent ages at 36-38Ma, indicating that both plutons were emplaced at the middle Eocene. Their generation is considered to have been derived through crustal anatexis of accretionary wedge in the lower crust shortly after tectonic thickening caused by the Okhotsk Sea Plate collision with the Eurasia Plate. Consequently, our age data constrain that the Okhotsk Sea Plate and Eurasia Plate collision occurred in the middle Eocene between 49 and 38Ma. This age range is consistent with late Eocene uncomformity identified in the Sakhalin Island and Okhotsk Sea.},

   abstract = {To better constrain the Early Paleozoic tectonic evolution of the western part of the Erguna-Xing'an Block, detrital zircon U-Pb dating was applied on the Ordovician to Devonian sedimentary strata along the southeast part of the China-Mongolia border. Most of the zircons from five sedimentary samples display fine-scale oscillatory growth zoning and Th/U ratios higher than 0.1, indicating a magmatic origin. All five Ordovician-Devonian samples display the similar age distribution patterns with age groups at similar to 440 Ma, similar to 510 Ma, similar to 800 Ma, similar to 950 Ma, and few Meso- to Paleo-Proterozoic and Neoarchean grains. This age distribution pattern is similar to those from adjacent blocks in the southeastern Central Asian Orogenic Belt. Considering previous tectonic studies, we propose bidirectional provenances from the Erguna-Xing'an Block and Baolidao Arc. Consequently, a new model was proposed to highlight the Early Paleozoic tectonic evolution of the western Erguna-Xing'an Block, which constrains two main Early Paleozoic tectonic events of the Xing-Meng Orogenic Belt: (a) pre-Late Cambrian collision between Erguna-Kerulen Block and Arigin Sum-Xilinhot-Xing'an Block; (b) the Early Paleozoic subduction of Paleo-Asian Ocean and pre-Late Devonian collision between Erguna-Xing'an Block and Songliao-Hunshandake Block.

   abstract = {In order to decipher crustal nature of the Sakhalin Island in Russian Far East, we carried out detrital zircon U-Pb age analyses on Miocene sandstone and river sand from the longest river (Poronay River) of the Sakhalin Island. The detrital zircon data from two river sand samples display similar age distribution patterns with a dominant Mesozoic age group, subordinate age peaks at 1.8 Ga and 2.5 Ga, and a few Paleozoic and Neoproterozoic grains. The Miocene sandstone shows age peaks at 22, 84, 260 and 497 Ma, respectively, and a few Paleo-proterozoic grains. These age groups indicate that abundant old crustal materials have been involved in the crustal formation of the Sakhalin Island. Detrital zircon result reveals two episodes of post-accretion magmatism from the Sakhalin Island in ages of 37 Ma and 22-21 Ma. They can be correlated with coeval post-accretion magmatic events in the Hokkaido Island, supporting the geological correlation between the Sakhalin Island and the Hokkaido Island. Comparison of detrital zircon dating result from the Sakhalin Island with those from surrounding blocks and cratons in eastern Asia allows us to propose two possible sources in eastern Asia: the Bureya-Jiamusi-Khanka block with the Sikhote-Alin orogenic belt to its west and the South China Craton. The detrital zircon result indicates that the formation of the Salchalin Island should be close to the East Asia continent, rather than as an independent intro-oceanic island arc within the Pacific Ocean. Similar to formation of the Japanese islands, the South China Craton may have played an important role during formation of the Sakhalin Island.},

   abstract = {Sedimentological and geochronological analyses were performed on Carboniferous strata from central Inner Mongolia (China) to determine the tectonic setting of the southeastern Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB). Sedimentological analyses indicate that the widespread Late Carboniferous strata in central Inner Mongolia were dominated by shallow marine dastic-carbonate deposition with basal conglomerate above the Precambrian basement and Early Paleozoic orogenic belts. Based on lithological comparison and fossil similarity, five sedimentary stages were used to represent the Carboniferous deposition. The depositional stages include, from bottom to top, 1) basal molassic, 2) first carbonate platform, 3) terrigenous with coeval intraplate volcanism, 4) second carbonate platform, and 5) post-carbonate terrigenous. These five stages provide evidence for an extensive transgression in central Inner Mongolia during the Late Carboniferous. Detrital zircon geochronological studies from five samples yielded five main age populations: similar to 310 Ma, similar to 350 Ma, 400-450 Ma, 800-1200 Ma and some Meso-Proterozoic to Neoarchean grains. The detrital zircon geochronological studies indicate that the provenances for these Late Carboniferous strata were mainly local magmatic rocks (Early Paleozoic arc magmatic rocks and Carboniferous intrusions) with subordinate input of Precambrian basement. Combining our sedimentological and provenance analyses with previous fossil comparison and paleomagnetic reconstruction, an inland sea was perceived to be the main paleogeographic feature for central Inner Mongolia during the Late Carboniferous. The inland sea developed on a welded continent after the collision between North China Craton and its northern blocks. (C) 2015 International Association for Gondwana Research. Elsevier B.V.

   abstract = {The Late Carboniferous-Early Permian is themost controversial period for the tectonic evolution of the southeastern Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB). In this study, we performed sedimentological and detrital zircon dating on the clastic sediments, as well as zircon U-Pb age and geochemical analysis on the rhyolitic rocks of the Late Carboniferous-Early Permian strata from northern Inner Mongolia (China). The sedimentological analysis showed that the Late Carboniferous-Early Permian sediments are composed of continental clastic and volcanic rocks with basal conglomerate overlying the Devonian strata. The detrital zircon study revealed three age peaks at similar to 300 Ma, similar to 440 Ma and similar to 530 Ma, indicating that the clastic rocks derived from Paleozoic magmatic rocks and pre-Carboniferous sediments from northern Inner Mongolia. The age data revealed that rhyolitic rocks from northern Inner Mongolia extruded in two stages at Late Carboniferous and latest Carboniferous-Early Permian. The Late Carboniferous rhyolites show I-to A-type granitic affinities whereas the latest Carboniferous-Early Permian rhyolites have A-type granitic characteristics. The difference suggests a transition of tectonic setting from post-collisional extension to intraplate rift. The Late Carboniferous-Early Permian strata from northern Inner Mongolia and South Mongolia show similar sedimentary facies, detrital zircon age distribution and geochemistry features, hence theywere probably deposited in the same tectonic setting. A unified block was finally proposed in northern Inner Mongolia and South Mongolia, where a rift system provided an intra-continental sedimentary basin and induced intense syn-rift magmatic activities. The intra-continental basin and syn-rift magmatism indicate that the Xing'an-Airgin Sum, Songliao-Hunshandake and South Mongolia Blocks in southeastern CAOB have been welded into a single continental block before the Late Carboniferous.

   abstract = {The Permian-Triassic boundary (PTB) mass extinction, the most severe biocrisis in Earth's history, is thought to have been triggered by catastrophic volcanic activity. PTB sections in South China contain numerous volcanic ash beds, the source of which is inferred to have been either the Siberian Traps Large Igneous Province (STLIP) or intraregional subduction-zone arc volcanism. In this study, the provenance of these ash beds is determined through a comprehensive analysis based on the geochronological and geochemical signatures of zircons from four PTB sections (Dongpan, Xinmin, Ganxi and Shangsi). Inherited zircons yielded U-Pb ages of 250-3521 Ma with major age clusters in the Permian, Carboniferous to Silurian, early Cambrian to Neoproterozoic, early Neoproterozoic to late Mesoproterozoic, and early Paleoproterozoic. The age spectrum of these zircons is similar to those of detrital zircons from sedimentary and magmatic rocks of the South China and Indochina cratons but different from those of the Siberian Craton, providing evidence for an intraregional source of the volcanic material. The trace-element, epsilon Hf(t), and delta O-18 signatures of syn-depositional magmatic zircons are consistent with an arc-related/orogenic setting. PTB sections in South China can be assigned to sectors based on the number and cumulative thickness of ash beds and the length of zircon crystals. Sector I (South) includes the Dongpan and Xinmin sections, which have cumulative ash-bed thicknesses of 0.86-1.14 m and average zircon lengths of 151-217 mu m. Sector II (North) includes the Ganxi, Shangsi and Daxiakou sections, which have cumulative ash bed thicknesses of 0.17-0.33 m and average zircon lengths of 82-104 mu m. Sector III (Northeast) includes the Niushan and Meishan sections, which have cumulative ash-bed thicknesses of 0.1-0.14 m and average zircon lengths of 71-73 mu m. Systematic trends toward fewer and thinner ash beds and as well as smaller zircon sizes from Sector I to Sector III indicate a paleo-northward or -northeastward direction of ash transport. Collectively, our findings provide evidence that the source of volcanic ash in South China PTB sections was intraregional subduction-zone arc volcanism along the convergent margin between the South China and Indochina cratons.},

   abstract = {The Paleozoic tectonic framework of the eastern Hexi Corridor Belt is ambiguous. However, thick Paleozoic sediments from the eastern Hexi Corridor Belt can provide clues to this problem. In this paper, we deal with the detrital zircon provenance of Middle Ordovician to Late Devonian strata using LA-ICP-MS U-Pb dating, documenting the temporal and spatial changes of provenance. Detrital zircon U-Pb ages indicate that the primary provenance was the Qilian Orogenic Belt and the Alxa Block. However, two samples from Late Devonian strata show different provenance characteristics, from the North Qilian Orogenic Belt, and the Alxa Block and the North China Block, respectively. Different age distributions through time reflect provenance changes due to continuous convergence of the Central Qilian Block and the Alxa Block from the Middle Ordovician to Late Devonian. A significant age cluster ranging from 2000 to 1800 Ma, which is a detrital zircon signature of the North China Block, appeared in the Late Devonian Zhongning Formation. Our preferred interpretation is that the amalgamation of the Alxa Block and the North China Block likely occurred at that time. Moreover, similar Paleozoic fossils, paleolatitudes and detrital zircon distribution indicate that the Hexi Corridor Belt has an affinity to eastern Gondwana. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

   abstract = {This study provides evidence for a continental-scale river system that existed in eastern Tibet before the India-Asia collision. The river system developed an extensive low-relief landscape, which was uplifted and dissected during the late Cenozoic. The establishment of continental-scale drainage systems on Earth is largely controlled by topography related to plate boundary deformation and buoyant mantle. Drainage patterns of the great rivers in Asia are thought to be highly dynamic during the Cenozoic collision of India and Eurasia, but the drainage pattern and landscape evolution prior to the development of high topography in eastern Tibet remain largely unknown. Here we report the results of petro-stratigraphy, heavy-mineral analysis, and detrital zircon U-Pb dating from late Cretaceous-early Palaeogene sedimentary basin strata along the present-day eastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau. Similarities in the provenance signatures among basins indicate that a continental-scale fluvial system once drained southward into the Neo-Tethyan Ocean. These results challenge existing models of drainage networks that flowed toward the East Asian marginal seas and require revisions to inference of palaeo-topography during the Late Cretaceous. The presence of a continent-scale river may have provided a stable long-term base level which, in turn, facilitated the development of an extensive low-relief landscape that is preserved atop interfluves above the deeply incised canyons of eastern Tibet.},

The Late Miocene-Quaternary landscape evolution of northern Tian Shan has been significantly driven by the interaction between tectonic deformations and climate change, further modulated by the erosion of the upstream bedrocks and deposition into the downstream basins. In this study, only the accessible Kuitun River drainage basin in northern Tian Shan was considered, and detrital zircon geochronology and heavy minerals were analyzed to investigate the signature of the driving forces for Miocene sedimentation in northern Tian Shan. This study first confirmed a previously recognized tectonic uplift at ca. 7.0 Ma and further revealed that the basin sediments were mainly derived from the present glacier-covered ridge-crest regions during 3.3-2.5 Ma. It is suggested Late-Pliocene to Early Pleistocene sedimentation was likely a response to the onset of the northern hemispheric glaciation. Although complicated, this study highlights that the tectonic-climatic interaction during the Late Cenozoic orogenesis can be discriminated in the northern Chinese Tian Shan.},

   abstract = {The drainage evolution in eastern Tibet during the India-Eurasia collision has attracted considerable attention because of its critical link to topographic development and plateau growth, but the discussion still persists. In the present study, new and published detrital zircon U-Pb ages are integrated from Pliocene-Early Pleistocene Xigeda Formation (XGD) and modern river sands to decipher the paleo-drainage evolution in eastern Tibet. The results confirm the eastward flow of the Jinsha River before the Pliocene, but the drainage patterns of its major tributaries (Dadu, Yalong, and Anning) in the Pliocene, differ from the modern ones. In conjunction with the previously documented fluvial incision in eastern Tibet, we interpreted that the excavation of the Paleo-Xigeda lake in Early Pleistocene time initiated and accentuated incision of the Jinsha River and its major tributaries. This led to drainage reorganization and the modern river pattern establishment in eastern Tibet. Plain Language Summary The developmental history of the Jinsha River and its major tributaries (Dadu, Yalong, and Anning) in eastern Tibet are considered to be closely associated with the topographic evolution during the Cenozoic plateau growth. However, the formation timing and mechanism of the current configuration of these large rivers remains debated. Here, we used detrital zircon U-Pb age as "provenance tracer" to identify source signatures of the Pliocene-Early Pleistocene Xigeda Formation, a sequence of lacustrine deposits sporadically distributed along the Middle Jinsha River and its large tributaries. Our provenance results demonstrate that current east-flowing Jinsha River has been established before Pliocene time, while the present-day pattern of its major tributaries, including the Yalong, Dadu, and Aning rivers, was achieved in the late Early Pleistocene. Combined with previous thermochronological and provenance studies, we infer that the spillover of dammed lake initiated the fluvial incision that led to drainage reorganization and, consequently, the formation of the modern river system. This study not only challenge existing models of Plio-Pleistocene drainage pattern of eastern Tibet that flowed southward to the South China Sea, but also illustrates how river reorganization alone can dramatically influence landscape development even in the absence of significant tectonic and climatic forces. Key Points The Jinsha River has flowed eastward before Pliocene time The present pattern of the Dadu, Yalong, and Anning Rivers achieved in the Early Pleistocene The spillover of the Paleo-Xigeda lake during the Early Pleistocene triggered incision of the Jinsha River and its major tributaries},

   abstract = {The Liupanshan Basin constitutes a major portion of the northern North-South tectonic belt. The Lower Cretaceous strata in the Liupanshan Basin recorded the tectono-sedimentary evolution processes of this area and are pivotal for understanding the original sedimentary appearance of the Liupanshan Basin. In this work, we present a study of provenance and tectono-sedimentary evolution of the Liupanshan Basin during the Early Cretaceous. Integrated-paleocurrent directions, gravel clast compositions, and detrital zircon U-Pb isotopic analysis of the Lower Cretaceous Sanqiao and Heshangpu formations were applied to determine the provenance. The gravel clast compositions of Sanqiao Formation conglomerates (mainly including magmatic rocks, metamorphic rocks and limestones) display various features in different places, revealing different rock components of source areas. The paleocurrent directions of the Sanqiao and Heshangpu formations suggest that the sediments were transported from the basin margin to the center. Detrital zircons of two samples from the Huoshizhai Section (northwestern Liupanshan Basin) yield a dominant unimodal distribution from 420 to 500 Ma, suggesting a single-sourced provenance. Based on the above analyses, comparing to the magmatic records in the Qilian-Qinling orogenic belt, the detritus of the Sanqiao and Heshangpu formations were mainly from the proximal metamorphic and magmatic rocks of the Qilian-Qinling orogenic belt and the limestones of the archaic uplift. Combined with sedimentary characteristics, we concluded that the Liupanshan Basin experienced multi-stage evolution history: (1) the early rifting extension stage (Sanqiao Period), (2) the middle spanning and depression stage (Heshangpu-Early Naijiahe Period), and (3) the late extinction stage (Late Naijiahe Period). The evolution of Liupanshan Basin is closely related to that of Ordos Basin and it is further associated with tectonic transition of the northern North-South tectonic belt.},

We present a new 1:50,000 map of the Rongma area in the central Qiangtang terrane, of which relatively little is known so far. We show that the Qiangtang metamorphic belt can be separated in a Paleozoic autochthonous basement and an overlying allochthonous thrust stack of subduction melange that contains high-pressure rocks and Permian sediments. Detrital zircon ages (youngest peak at 591 Ma) and an similar to 470 Ma granite intrusion age constrain the age of the Qiangtang Basement to be between the Late Precambrian to Middle Ordovician. This is in agreement with the observed unconformity between basement and overlying Mid-Late Ordovician strata. This unconformity and the zircon age spectra are comparable to the Himalaya area. The Qiangtang terrane must thus have been part of the Gondwana supercontinent during the Early Paleozoic. The occurrence of the Late Triassic eclogite and glaucophane-bearing schists in the Central Qiangtang terrane indicates the existence of a suture zone between the North and South Qiangtang terranes before the Late Triassic. This suture zone resulted from closure of the Paleo-Tethys between the North and South Qiangtang terranes. Late Triassic syn-collisional granites and rapidly exhumed high-pressure rocks resulted from the closure of this ocean and final amalgamation of the re-united Qiangtang terranes with Eurasia. Collision of the Lhasa and Qiangtang terranes is correlated with north dipping reverse faults in the south Qiangtang terrane, which were probably related to exhumation of the Qiangtang basement and formation of the Qiangtang Culmination.

   abstract = {It is thought that the North China Block collided with Pangea earlier than the closure of the Mianlue Ocean between the South and North China Blocks. Therefore, the closure of the Mianlue Ocean, which induced the formation of the Qinling-Dabie Orogen, led to the amalgamation of the South China Block and Pangea. Yet, the timing of closure remains poorly constrained. We present detrital zircon U-Pb ages, trace element and Hf isotopic data for an upper Permian-lower Triassic sedimentary succession in the Western Hubei Basin, northern Yangtze Block, South China. One major age population of 250-330 Ma and four minor age populations of 400-650 Ma, 1030-1300 Ma, 1600-2000 Ma and 2300-2800 Ma were identified. Trace element and Hf isotopic data indicate zircons in the major age population may have sourced from active continental margins. When integrated with tectono-magmatic events of adjacent blocks, our data support that these detrital zircons were mainly sourced from the Qinling Orogen in the southern North China Block. Combined with continental subduction-related metamorphic events in the Dabie Terrane and syn-collisional granitoids in the West Qinling Belt, as well as the paleomagnetic data, our data support that the Mianlue Ocean experienced a scissors-like closure from the Late Permian in the east to the Middle Triassic in the west. In the middle of the Qinling-Dabie Orogen, the closure of the ocean took place earlier than similar to 255 Ma. This study supports the hypothesis that the South China Block became a part of Pangea during the Late Permian-Middle Triassic.},

   abstract = {The Proterozoic is the longest Eon in geological history and witnessed the assemblies and breakups of the Columbia and Rodinia supercontinents. The Tarim Craton has been proposed to be a building block of these supercontinents. However, its tectonic evolution during late Paleoproterozoic to earliest Neoproterozoic (ca. 1.8-0.8 Ga) has been poorly understood, due to the paucity of geological record. In this paper, we present U-Pb and Lu-Hf isotopic data for detrital zircons from the metasediments of the early Neoproterozoic Paergangtag Group and the Paleoproterozoic Xinditag Group in the Kuruktag area, northern Tarim Craton. Although formed approximately 1 billion years later, the Paergangtag Group contains detrital zircons almost identical to those in the Xinditag Group. LA-ICP-MS U-Pb dating yields a ca. 2.0 Ga age peak, as well as a group of older zircons of ca. 2.5 Ga in six samples from these two groups. Lu-Hf data show that the ca. 2.0 Ga zircons have variable epsilon Hf(t) values (- 28.1 to 0.1), indicating the detritus were mostly derived from reworked continental crusts. The older zircons around 2.5 Ga have both negative and positive epsilon Hf(t) values (- 28.5 to 9.5), indicating a prolonged and complicated crustal growth and reworking process in the source area. It is inferred that the zircons in these samples were likely derived from southeastern Tarim Craton, where a ca. 2.0 Ga orogenic event has been documented. The fact that the Neoproterozoic Paergangtag Group contains only Paleoproterozoic and older zircons suggests that the Tarim Craton was not involved in the Grenville Orogeny, which developed between the colliding continents in the interior of the Rodinia Supercontinent. In contrast, the Tarim Craton was probably on the periphery of the Rodinia Supercontinent and was involved in the peripheral subduction zone of the supercontinent shortly after the deposition of the Paergangtag Group. Our new data imply that the Tarim Craton might have been a tectonically stable continent for nearly 1 billion years from ca. 1.8 to 0.9 Ga.},

Despite this, the age of the Yangtze River system has been strongly debated, with estimates ranging from 40 to 45 Ma, to a more recent initiation around 2 Ma. Here, we present Ar-40/Ar-39 ages from basalts interbedded with fluvial sediments from the lower reaches of the Yangtze together with detrital zircon U-Pb ages from sand grains within these sediments. We show that a river containing sediments indistinguishable from the modern river was established before similar to 23 Ma. We argue that the connection through the Three Gorges must postdate 36.5 Ma because of evaporite and lacustrine sedimentation in the Jianghan Basin before that time. We propose that the present Yangtze River system formed in response to regional extension throughout eastern China, synchronous with the start of strike-slip tectonismand surface uplift in eastern Tibet and fed by strengthened rains caused by the newly intensified summer monsoon.},

   abstract = {The First Bend on the Yangtze River (China), the point where the river ceases flowing toward the south and heads toward the northeast, has been one of the most strongly debated geomorphic features in Asia because it holds the key to understanding the history of the Yangtze River and is linked to the tectonically driven surface uplift of the southeastern Tibetan Plateau. Mid- to upper Eocene sedimentary rocks preserved in the Jianchuan Basin located immediately southwest of the First Bend demonstrate that a large river system, presumably the paleo-Jinshajiang River (the upper Yangtze), used to flow south through that region. Provenance analysis of sediments over the wider region, based mostly on U-Pb dating of detrital zircon grains, confirms that the once south-flowing paleo-Yangtze River originated in the Tibetan Plateau and flowed into the South China Sea. Inversion of the Jianchuan Basin, starting in or after the latest Eocene and associated with wider plateau surface uplift at that time, caused the river to be diverted toward the northeast where it was confined along tectonic lineaments associated with strike-slip faulting, giving birth to the First Bend, a major step in the formation of the modern Yangtze River.},

   journal = {International Journal of Earth Sciences},
   abstract = {The Changning-Menglian Belt in western Yunnan, China has been widely considered as the remnants of Paleo-Tethys. However, its geological history remains waiting for further clarification. An efficient approach to this goal is to identify the tectono-sedimentary environment of different stratigraphic successions within the belt. This study examines the Nanpihe Formation, a Devonian to Early Carboniferous siliciclastics-dominated succession in the central zone of the belt. Our sedimentologic and petrographic results reveal that this formation comprises largely turbidity current deposits. Geochemical results indicate that its source area was rich in continental island arc rocks. Detrital zircon age spectra of this formation exhibit remarkable age clusters of ca. 435 Ma and ca. 950 Ma. The former is well-correlated with Silurian magmatism in the Simao and South China blocks. We thus consider that this formation was deposited in a continental slope environment along the west margin of the Simao Block, instead of the eastern margin of the Baoshan-Shan Block. We further consider that sometime in the Permian or Early Triassic, as the eastward subduction of the Paleo-Tethys progressed, the Nanpihe Formation was sheared off or collapsed from the overriding margin of the Simao Block and entered the accretionary wedge, which contained a significant amount of rock slices scraped off the subducting oceanic plate. During the closure of Paleo-Tethys in the Late Triassic, this formation and some other slices of the accretionary wedge were thrust onto the east flank of the Baoshan-Shan block.},

   abstract = {The Changning-Menglian Belt in western Yunnan, China, has been considered for decades as a remnant of Paleo-Tethys in this region. However, the understanding of the geological evolution of the belt remains sketchy and incomplete. As a significant component of the stratigraphic successions in the eastern part of the belt, the siliciclastic Nanduan Formation preserved essential information of the developing history of the belt. Petrologic studies of the formation show that it was deposited in a neritic environment. The increase of mudstone beds and decrease of grain size of sandstones upwards suggest a gradual deepening of sedimentary environment. Petrographic and geochemical characteristics of sandstones show that they were derived from mature continental provenance and deposited in a passive continental margin setting. Detrital zircon ages of the formation range from 362 to 3685 Ma. The youngest detrital zircon age (362.2 +/- 5.5 Ma) confines the deposition age of the sandstones to being younger than the latest Devonian. Dominant age populations of ca. 950 Ma and ca. 550 Ma can be correlated with the magmatic events that occurred in Eastern Ghats-northern Prince Charles (India-Antarctica) (ca. 950 Ma) and Pan-African orogens (Australia-India) (ca. 550 Ma), which are considered, therefore, to be the main provenance of the Nanduan Formation. These results let us consider that the Nanduan Formation and the underlying Lancang Group were formed on the margin of the Baoshan-Shan Block (therefore, autochthonous), and the Carboniferous. Permian limestones of seamount resemblance, the oceanic bedded cherts, and basic and ultra-basic igneous rocks in the central zone of the belt are overthrusted slices (allochthonous).},

   abstract = {The ages and origins of metasedimentary rocks, which were previously mapped as Precambrian, are critical in rebuilding the orogenic process and better understanding the Phanerozoic continental growth in the Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB). The Beishan Complex was widely distributed in the southern Beishan Orogenic Collage, southernmost CAOB, and their ages and tectonic affinities are still in controversy. The Beishan Complex was previously proposed as fragments drifted from the Tarim Craton, Neoproterozoic Block or Phanerozoic accretionary complex. In this study, we employ detrital zircon age spectra to constrain ages and provenances of metasedimentary sequences of the Beishan Complex in the Chuanshanxun area. The metasedimentary rocks here are dominated by zircons with Paleoproterozoic-Mesoproterozoic age (similar to 1160-2070 Ma), and yield two peak ages at 1454 and 1760 Ma. One sample yielded a middle Permian peak age (269 Ma), which suggests that the metasedimentary sequences were deposited in the late Paleozoic. The granitoid and dioritic dykes, intruding into the metasedimentary sequences, exhibit zircon U-Pb ages of 268 and 261 Ma, respectively, which constrain the minimum deposit age of the metasedimentary sequences. Zircon U-Pb ages of amphibolite (274 and 216 Ma) indicate that they might be affected by multi-stage metamorphic events. The Beishan Complex was not a fragment drifted from the Tarim Block or Dunhuang Block, and none of cratons or blocks surrounding Beishan Orogenic Collage was the sole material source of the Beishan Complex due to obviously different age spectra. Instead, 1.4 Ga marginal accretionary zones of the Columbia supercontinent might have existed in the southern CAOB, and may provide the main source materials for the sedimentary sequences in the Beishan Complex.},

   abstract = {Numerous ore-grade heavy mineral placer deposits occur in the northern South China Sea region. Previous studies on these deposits have focused on the heavy-mineral ore resources themselves, but the provenance and transport pathways of these heavy minerals are poorly constrained. This paper presents U-Pb ages of detrital zircons from sediments within the northwestern shelf of the South China Sea, and uses this new dataset to determine the provenance and transport pathway of the sediments. Zircons in sediments from ten areas of the northwestern shelf exhibit distinct age populations, suggesting that they have multiple provenances. Zircons in sediments from the Pearl River Mouth, Shangchuan Island, and Moyang River Mouth areas all have an obvious peak of Mesozoic ages, indicating that they have similar sediment provenances; i.e., mainly from the Pearl River, and to a lesser degree from the Moyang River. Zircons in sediments from the areas around the Jian River Mouth and Leizhou Bay, and off Hainan Island have an early Paleozoic age, suggesting that the sediments predominantly originate from the Yunkai massif. Zircons of the sediments from the remaining four areas, the Leigiong Strait, Wanquan River Mouth, Qiongdongnan, and the Outer Shelf, have Yanshannian and Indosinian age peaks in addition to an obvious early Paleozoic population, implying mixed provenances, including the Yunkai massif and Hainan Island. The sediment transport may have involved two hydrodynamic conditions in two distinct stages. First, the Guangdong Longshore Current carried the river sediments to where they dispersed in the inner shelf; subsequently, wave-induced strong currents further transported sandy sediments southeastward to the outer shelf. In addition to explaining the provenance and transport pathways of heavy minerals within the northwestern shelf of the South China Sea, these results provide new information relevant to exploration for heavy-mineral placer deposits.

   abstract = {The tectonically active eastern Tibetan Plateau (TP) impacts the populous Sichuan Basin in the form of dust and exhumed detrital materials. To better understand a detailed transport process of detrital material from the eastern TP to the Sichuan Basin, eight samples were collected from the upper reaches of the MM River in the eastern TP to the Sichuan Basin, for zircon U-Pb chronological and grain-size analysis. The results are compared with those of previously studies. Zircon grains are comparatively coarse in three bedrock samples, one fluvial sand sample and one dust sample, but are distinctly fine in three lacustrine samples. Intriguingly, the zircon grain-size parameters from the fluvial sand and dust samples are similar to each other. Consistent with previous studies of this area, the analysis of our U-Pb zircon ages indicates five major age populations at 180-350 Ma, 350-550 Ma, 700-1000 Ma, 1600-2000 Ma, and 2200-2600 Ma, which broadly correspond to five known granitoid magmatic events within the Yangtze Block. The MM River links lacustrine sediments from Lixian, fluvial sands from Wenchuan, Leshan, Yibin, and from the Dadu River and the Dayi conglomerate, implying the Dayi conglomerate was transported by fluvial rather than glacial processes. The denuded detrital material, mainly generated by seismic events in the eastern TP, was transported by water flow into the western Sichuan Basin, where two thick sedimentary depocenters developed, and the relatively fine grains were then transported by wind to the northern Sichuan Basin. Thus, the thick sediments in the western Sichuan Basin mainly transported by the Min River probably exerted a major influence on dust deposition in the northern Sichuan Basin. In contrast, the Jialing and Dadu rivers made a minor contribution.},

   abstract = {Qimantage Orogen as the western part of East Kunlun Mountains is located in the northeastern margin of the Tibet Plateau. In this contribution, detrital zircon age spectra combined with heavy mineral analysis of Cenozoic sediments from Qaidam Basin were applied to reveal the uplift history of Qimantage Mountains. Our results show that the Cenozoic staged uplift of the Qimantage Mountains exhibit eastward and northward uplift characteristics. From the middle Eocene to Quaternary, there are three major uplift stages for Qimantage Mountains: the first stage is from middle Eocene to late Eocene (similar to 45-35.3 Ma). The range developed a topographic pattern of east-high and west-low at that time, and the uplift of the east part range at that time is significant perhaps linked to the Cenozoic uplift of Tibetan Plateau due to its significant crustal shortening. The second stage is from early Oligocene to late Miocene (similar to 15-8 Ma). During this stage, the uplift is both significant in tectonic and topographic aspects, and the overall uplift occurred mainly in the middle and west part of Qimantage Mountains. The last stage is from late Miocene to Quaternary (similar to 2.8 Ma to present), and the Qimantage Mountains experienced complete uplift. The provenance is mainly the northern Qimantage Mountains without sediments supplied from further south, and therefore, the Qaidam Basin became an intermontane basin geomorphically.},

This paper presents detrital zircon U-Pb and Hf isotopic data of early Paleozoic strata in the Zhangjiatun arc terrane of central Jilin Province, northeast (NE) China, and compares them with the Bainaimiao and Jiangyu arc terranes abutting the northern margin of the NCC. Detrital zircons from early Paleozoic strata in three arc terranes exhibit comparable age groupings of 539-430, 1250-577, and 2800-1600 Ma. The Paleoproterozoic to Neoarchean ages and Hf isotopic composition of the detrital zircons imply the existence of the Precambrian fragments beneath the arc terranes. Given the evidences from geology, igneous rocks, and detrital zircons, we proposed that the early Paleozoic arc terranes abutting the northern margin of the NCC are a united arc terrane including the exotic Precambrian fragments, and these fragments shared a common evolutionary history from Neoproterozoic to early-middle Paleozoic.},

   abstract = {As a main part of the North China craton collage system, the tectonic origin of the Bainaimiao arc terrane is still hotly debated, especially its relationship with the North China craton. Thus, we report on a field-based petrological and zircon U-Pb-Hf isotopic study of (meta-)sedimentary and volcanic rocks from the Bainaimiao arc terrane and northern margin of the North China craton in the Damao region. The lower and middle successions of the Bayan Obo Group from the northern North China craton, including the Dulahala, Jianshan, Halahuogete, and Bilute Formations, were deposited ca. 1.81-1.35 Ga and show age peaks at 1.85, 1.90, 2.0, and 2.5 Ga. This age pattern is in accordance with the coeval and extensively outcropped metamorphosed basement rocks of the northern North China craton. The upper succession, including the Bayin-baolage and Hujiertu Formations, deposited ca. 1.19-0.92 Ga, shows age peaks at ca. 1.35, 1.57, and 1.69 Ga, and sediments were derived from coeval rift-related magmatism characterized by a significant increase in positive epsilon(Hf)(t) values in detrital zircons. Thus, the Bayan Obo Group can be subdivided into North China craton basement-derived sediments and Mesoproterozoic to Neoproterozoic rift-derived sediments, and the change of the provenance was probably caused by the ca. 1.35-1.30 Ga rifting event related to the breakup of the Nuna supercontinent. In the Bainaimiao arc terrane, zircon U-Pb geochronological results of (meta-)sedimentary rocks indicate they were formed in the Neoproterozoic and Paleozoic and have mainly late Paleoproterozoic to Neoproterozoic ages (ca. 0.6-0.9, 1.1-1.2, 1.4-1.7, and 1.8-2.0 Ga) with peaks at ca. 0.86, 0.96, 1.15, 1.47, 1.66, 1.75, 1.80-1.87, and 1.94 Ga. The abundant Neoproterozoic ages for the Bainaimiao arc terrane detrital zircons are distinct from the scarcity of these ages in the northern North China craton, southern Siberia (age peaks at ca. 1.87, 1.92, and 2.0 Ga), and Mongolia (age peak at ca. 0.62, 0.83, 0.93, 1.84, and 2.0 Ga), but they are similar to the features of the Tarim craton (age peaks at ca. 0.62, 0.85, 1.15, 1.47, 1.66, 1.75-1.80, 1.85, and 1.94 Ga). Together with the recognition of a possible preexisting Proterozoic basement (ca. 0.7-2.0 Ga) in the Bainaimiao arc terrane, as evidenced by the Hf model ages of continental arc magmatism in the Bainaimiao arc terrane, this late Paleoproterozoic to Neoproterozoic detritus probably resulted from local recycled sedimentation, and the preexisting Bainaimiao arc terrane basement rifted away from a continent with Tarim craton affinity. The rifting probably occurred between ca. 0.6 and 0.52 Ga, because the reworking of the Precambrian rocks in the North China collage system occurred between ca. 520 and 230 Ma.},

   abstract = {The Laiyang Basin is located in the northern margin of the Sulu high-pressure and ultrahigh-pressure (HP-UHP) metamorphic belt. The sediment source and depositional time of the Laiyang Basin can provide important insights into the exhumation mechanism of the Sulu Orogen and the formation of the Tancheng-Lujiang (Tan-Lu) Fault, but have not been well constrained. In this study, seven samples were collected from typical sections of the Laiyang and Qingshan groups in the southern margin of the Laiyang Basin in the Sulu Orogen. LA-ICPMS U-Pb dating of detrital zircon from these samples yielded ages from 3145 Ma to 115 Ma and can be divided into four groups: (1) 3145-1728 Ma, which indicate a provenance from the Precambrian basement rocks of the North China Craton; (2) 908-522 Ma, which are consistent with the ages of the protolith of the Sulu HP-UHP rocks; (3) 240-220 Ma, which are identical to the ages of the HP-UHP metamorphism. This suggests that the HP-UHP rocks of the Sulu Orogen had been exposed to the surface and contributed to the deposition of the Laiyang Group by the Early Cretaceous; (4) 148-115 Ma (weighted mean age: 125 +/- 0.5 Ma; MSWD = 1.2), which, as the main group, suggests that the major source of the sediments in the Laiyang Group was from Early Cretaceous igneous rocks. These young ages, combined with the ages of 119 1 (MSWD = 0.7) Ma determined from the overlain Qingshan Group, confine the depositional age of the Laiyang Group to 119-125 Ma. Further comparison of detrital zircon U-Pb age spectrum between the Laiyang Basin and the Hefei Basin indicates that these two basins were developed independently, rather than developed from single basin and then truncated by the Tan-Lu Fault as suggested by previous studies. Based on the formation age of the Laiyang Basin and other age constraints, we further suggest that the Tan-Lu Fault was formed during the Late Triassic to Early Jurassic. The Mesozoic geological settings in the Sulu Orogen, including the sediments of the Laiyang Basin, Early Cretaceous magmatic intrusive and detachment activities of the Wulian Fault, imply that the Cretaceous exhumation of the Sulu HPUHP belt was consistent with a metamorphic core complex model.},

LA-ICPMS U-Pb dating of detrital zircon yields ages of 635 to 1074 Ma for three samples from the Jinping Formation and 611 to 943 Ma for two samples from the Yuntai Formation. More than 78% of the detrital zircons from the two formations have U-Pb ages grouped between 700 and 890 Ma, with two clusters peaking at 758 Ma and 828 Ma, respectively. This indicates that their provenance is magmatic rocks of Neoproterozoic age that have a tectonic affinity to the South China Block (SCB). A few older zircon populations with peak U-Pb ages at 943 and 1074 Ma are also present. A younger population shows peaks at 661 and 611 Ma. This suggests that deposition of the Haizhou Group was later than similar to 611 Ma rather than during the Mesoproterozoic as previously thought Zircon Lu-Hf isotope data collected from the same U-Pb sites show negative epsilon(Hf)(t) values of -22.8 to -7.4 and Hf model ages of 2341 to 3100 Ma. This indicates that the Neoproterozoic magmatic rocks were derived from reworking of ancient Paleoproterozoic to Archean crust. The results support the contention that the Haizhou Group is similar to the Wulian Group at the northwestem edge of the Sulu orogen, both having a SCB affinity, but that the Penglai Group does not belong to the SCB because of the absence of Neoproterozoic ages. This lends support to the conclusion that the Triassic suture between the North China and South China blocks is located along the Baichihe-Yantai Fault, which lies north of the Wulian Complex and south of the Jiaobei Terrane; thus the Wulian-Yantai Fault is not the suture zone as is traditionally proposed.

   abstract = {The Nadanhada Terrane, located along the eastern margin of Eurasia, contains a typical accretionary complex related to paleo-Pacific plate subduction-accretion. The Yuejinshan Complex is the first stage accretion complex that consists of meta-clastic rocks and metamafic-ultramafic rocks, whereas the Raohe Complex forms the main parts of the terrane and consists of limestone, bedded chert, and mafic-ultramafic rocks embedded as olistolith blocks in a weakly sheared matrix of clastic meta-sedimentary rocks. Geochemical data indicate that the Yuejinshan metabasalts have normal mid-ocean ridge basalt (N-MORB) affinity, whereas the Raohe basaltic pillow lavas have an affinity to ocean island basalts (OIB). Sensitive high-resolution ion microprobe (SHRIMP) U-Pb zircon analyses of gabbro in the Raohe Complex yield a weighted mean Pb-206/U-238 zircon age of 2165Ma, whereas two samples of granite intruded into the complex yield weighted mean Pb-206/U-238 zircon ages of 1282 and 1292Ma. Laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICPMS) U-Pb zircon analyses of basaltic pillow lava in the Raohe Complex define a weighted mean age of 1671Ma. Two sandstone samples in the Raohe Complex record younger concordant zircon weighted mean ages of 167 +/- 17 and 137 +/- 3Ma. These new data support the view that accretion of the Raohe Complex was between 170 and 137Ma, and that final emplacement of the Raohe Complex took place at 137-130Ma. The accretion of the Yuejinshan Complex probably occurred between the 210 and 180Ma, suggesting that paleo-Pacific plate subduction was initiated in the Late Triassic to Early Jurassic.},

   abstract = {Controversy has long surrounded the emplacement time of the Hegenshan ophiolite that is considered to mark a suture zone, called the Hegenshan-Heihe suture, resulting from the closure of a back-arc basin in the Paleo-Asian Ocean. The Hegenshan ophiolite in the Xiaobaliang area is unconformably overlain by a sequence of Paleozoic strata, called the Zhesi Formation that consists of conglomerate, sandstone, siltstone and limestone, some of which contain Permian marine fossils of Brachiopods. Therefore, the ages of these Paleozoic strata can be used to constrain the emplacement time of the Hegenshan ophiolite. Four samples of the Zhesi Formation collected in the Xiaobaliang area yield the detrital zircon U-Pb ages of 285-272 Ma (with the peak at 279 Ma), 315288 Ma (with a peak at 300 Ma), 320-358 Ma (with a peak at 336 Ma), and 406 +/- 3 Ma, of which the similar to 280 and similar to 300 Ma age groups are remarkably similar to the ages of latest Carboniferous-Early Permian Gegenaobao/Dashizai Formation, or A-type granites, which formed under a post-collisional setting. However, the age groups of 320 to 358 Ma with a peak at 336 Ma, show the features of mafic-ultramafic zircons in CL image, most likely derived from local mafic-ultramafic rocks of the Hegenshan ophiolite in the Xiaobaliang area, which is supported by the fact of the ophiolite unconformably overlain by the Middle Permian Zhesi Formation. Therefore, we propose that the emplacement time of the Hegenshan ophiolite must have happened at some time before the Middle Permian (similar to 280 Ma), most likely between 300 and 335 Ma, not in the Silurian, Devonian or Mesozoic as previously considered.

   abstract = {Rocks that crop out in the northern part of the Songliao Block are mainly consist of high-grade metamorphic gneiss, Paleozoic strata and Mesozoic granites. They are essentially similar to rocks reported from beneath the Songliao Basin that occupies the majority of the Songliao Block. Four samples of Paleozoic metasedimentary rocks from Tieli in the north-eastern part of the Songliao Bloc K yield detrital zircon U-Pb ages ranging from 2690 to 501 Ma, with four age populations at: 2071-2690 Ma, with a peak at 2585 Ma; 1776-1997 Ma, with a peak at 1890 Ma; 719-991 Ma, with a peak at 800 Ma; and 501-592 Ma, with a peak at 518 Ma. These are similar to age populations in other parts of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB), although sediments from the Songliao Block contain more abundant Archean and Proterozoic detrital zircons than the neighboring Jiamusi-Khanka Block to the east and Xing'an Block to the west. This may indicate that rocks of this age comprise a minor component of the Songliao Block. The Pan-African zircon ages from the Songliao Block, taken together with similar to 500 Ma magmatic and high-grade metamorphic zircons obtained from the nearby Erguna, Xing'an and Jiamus:-Khanka blocks, indicate that Pan-African events affected all blocks of the CAOB in NE China. This suggests that these blocks not only share a common basement, but that they had a common history. An extensive Late Pan-African (similar to 500 Ma) orogenic terrane thus occupies much of the CAOB in NE China. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {The Erguna block is a crustal unit located along the eastern margin of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB) in the far north of China. It contains a variety of khondalitic rocks that include sillimanite- and garnet-bearing gneiss, biotite-plagioclase gneiss and carbonate, in association with hornblende-plagioclase gneiss and a variety of granitic orthogneisses. These rocks are collectively referred to as the Mohe Complex and make up the basement rocks in this poorly exposed terrane. Four samples were analyzed for this study, including two samples of biotite-plagioclase gneiss, one sample of garnet-sillimanite gneiss, and a sample of hornblende-plagioclase gneiss. All samples provide evidence of metamorphism in the form of discrete zircon grains or metamorphic rims around detrital cores and they record remarkably consistent Pb-206/U-238 ages between 495 +/- 2 Ma and 497 +/- 6 Ma. Detrital zircon cores with oscillatory zoning from the two biotite-plagioclase gneiss samples yield magmatic ages that range from 608 +/- 8 Ma to 1015 +/- 12 Ma, whereas those in the garnet-sillimanite gneiss range from 678 +/- 8 to 1373 +/- 17 Ma. These results establish that a range of Meso- to Neoproterozoic magmatic rocks were present in the source area and contributed to the sedimentary protoliths. The youngest zircon core with an age of 608 +/- 8 Ma limits the maximum possible age of deposition, indicating that the rocks of the Mohe Complex cannot be late Archean to Early Proterozoic as previously considered. The similar to 500 Ma age for the granulite facies metamorphic event in the Mohe Complex is identical to that recorded in the Mashan Complex of the Jiamusi block and the Hutou Complex of the Khanka block, >1000 km to the south-southeast, implying that an extensive early Paleozoic khondalite belt extended across much of the eastern CAOB. Rocks of similar age and metamorphic grade have also been recorded from the Sayang-Baikal Orogen along the southern margin of the Siberia Craton, >1000 km to the west. It is unclear at present whether these two belts are directly related but, whatever the relationship, it is evident that extensive tracts of khondalitic rocks were present in the eastern CAOB. They were subsequently affected by high-grade metamorphism in the Early Paleozoic, forming collisional accretionary terranes that were accreted during the Late Pan-African global event.

The basement rocks constitute a khondalitic sequence of sillimanite- and garnet-bearing gneisses, hornblende-plagioclase gneiss and felsic paragneiss named the Xinghuadukou Complex. LA-ICP-MS zircon U-Pb dating of a sillimanite gneiss from Hanjiayuan indicates high-grade metamorphism occurred at 496 +/- 3 Ma, with several older detrital zircon grains with ages extending from 678 +/- 8 to 1373 +/- 17 Ma. A sample of hornblende-plagioclase gneiss from the northern part of the Xinghuadukou Complex yields a metamorphic age of 496 +/- 7 Ma, whereas igneous zircon core ages range from 601 +/- 15 to 1637 +/- 23 Ma. Another sample of hornblende-plagioclase gneiss from farther south in the Xinghuadukou Complex yields a metamorphic age of 495 +/- 5 Ma, and magmatic core ages of 546 +/- 4 Ma. These data indicate that high-grade metamorphism occurred at similar to 500 Ma and that several earlier magmatic events are recorded in the area, including some in the Neoproterozoic.

   abstract = {The Khanka Massif forms the easternmost segment of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB) in NE China and its tectonic setting is highly controversial. Metasedimentary rocks from the Hulin Complex and the Mt. Huoshi sequence were selected to address this issue. For the Hulin Complex, SHRIMP detrital zircon U-Pb dating of a two-mica schist (sample HL-011) reveals a unimodal population with a weighted mean Pb-206/U-238 age of 257 +/- 3 Ma, suggesting local derivation from nearby Permian granitoids. In contrast, a quartz schist (sample 04H-138) contains five zircon populations with ages of 233-270 Ma, 350-400 Ma, 473-570 Ma, 720-760 Ma and 930-970 Ma, and peaks at 252,350,520,758 and 970 Ma, indicating a much more diverse provenance. Two samples of fine-grained gneiss were selected from Mt Houshi, with sample 06H-15 containing four zircon populations, with groupings at 260-340 Ma, 470-560 Ma, 710-940 Ma and a single grain at 2090 Ma, whereas zircons in sample 06H-16 define two populations with ages of 727-854 Ma, with a peak at 776 Ma, and a single grain with an age of 404 +/- 13 Ma. The youngest detrital zircon was obtained from sample 04H-138 and has a Pb-206/U-238 age of 233 +/- 9 Ma, limiting deposition of the Hulin Complex to after similar to 233 Ma. The late Pan-African and Paleoproterozoic to Neoproterozoic ages, together with the similar to 500 Ma age for granulite facies metamorphism previously determined for the Hutou Complex in the Khanka Massif, indicate that the Khanka and Jiamusi massifs (together with the Bureya Massif in Russia) formed a contiguous crustal unit. Detrital zircon data suggest that this combined block was not part of either the North China or the South China cratons. Instead, it was either derived from a peri-Gondwana position, a rifted portion of the Songliao Massif in the CAOB, an exotic block of unknown affinity, or from the Siberia Craton. We evaluate the possibility that the Khanka/Jiamusi/Bureya block may have originated in Siberia and once formed part of the Sayan-Baikal orogen at similar to 500 Ma. Whatever its origin, the block drifted westward to collide with the Songliao Massif of NE China in the latest Triassic-Early Jurassic as a result of the onset of Pacific-plate subduction. It thus forms part of the evolving supercontinent of Eurasia. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Archean basement gneisses and supracrustal rocks, together with Neoproterozoic (Sinian) metasedimentary rocks (the Penglai Group) occur in the Jiaobei Terrane at the southeastern margin of the North China Craton. SHRIMP U-Pb zircon dating of an Archean TTG gneiss gave an age of 2541 +/- 5 Ma, whereas metasedimentary rocks from the Neoproterozoic Penglai Group yielded a range in zircon ages from 2.9 to 1.8 Ga. The zircons can be broadly divided into three age populations, at: 2.0-1.8 Ga, 2.45-2.1 Ga and >2.5 Ga. Detrital zircon grains with ages >2.6 Ga are few in number and there are none with ages <1.8 Ga. These results indicate that most of the detrital material comes from a Paleoproterozoic source, most likely from the Jianshan and Fenzishan groups, with some materialcoming from Archean gneisses in the Jiaobei Terrane. An age of 1866 +/- 4 Ma for amphibolite-facies hornblende-plagioclase gneiss, forming part of a supracrustal sequence within the Archean TTG gneiss, indicates Late Paleoproterozoic metamorphism. Both the Archean gneiss complex and Penglai metasedimentary rocks resemble previously described components of the Jiao-Liao-Ji orogenic belt and suggest that the Jiaobei Terrane has a North China Craton affinity; they also suggest that the time of collision along the Jiao-Liao-Ji Belt was at similar to 1865 Ma.

   abstract = {The mafic-ultramafic rocks in the Fanjingshan Group from northeastern Guizhou have been classified as the calc-alkaline series. These mafic rocks have prominent negative Nb, Ta and Ti but positive Pb anomalies and show typical geochemical signatures of arc basalts and decoupling Nd-Hf isotopic characters. SHRIMP and LA-ICP-MS U-Pb zircon datings for four samples of the mafic rocks yield U-Pb zircon ages of 814 +/- 15 Ma, 814 +/- 6 Ma, 831 +/- 6 Ma and 827 +/- 24 Ma with an average age of 822 +/- 15 Ma. The U-Pb ages of the youngest detrital zircon grains in four samples of the sandstones from the Fanjingshan Group are 873 +/- 4 Ma, 874 +/- 10 Ma, 870 +/- 10 Ma and 869 +/- 9 Ma with an average age of 872 +/- 3 Ma that is considered as the maximum depositional age of these sandstones. It suggests that the Fanjingshan Group, the equivalent of the Sibao and Lengjiaxi Groups occurring in the western Jiangnan orogen, is Neoproterozoic rather than Mesoproterozoic as previously considered. Combined with published age data, the U-Pb zircon dating of both mafic rocks and sandstones in the Fanjingshan Group provides new constraints on the timing of various geological events during the development of the Jiangnan orogen. it is evident that there existed coeval magmatism (878-822 Ma) with arc signatures and sedimentation (872-835 Ma) in the foreland basin along the southeastern margin of the Yangtze Block during the Neoproterozoic. Compared with the Grenvillian-age orogenic event, the collision between the Yangtze and Cathaysia Blocks was postponed for 355-160 Ma. Moreover, the basement strata in the Jiangnan orogen underwent thorough greenschist-facies metamorphism. The prevalent granulite-facies metamorphism in the Grenvillian orogenic belts has not been found in the metamorphosed sedimentary-igneous rocks of the basement strata exposed in the Jiangnan orogen. All these suggest that the Jiangnan orogen should not be considered as a Grenvillian-age orogenic belt. It is proposed that the Jiangnan orogen might be the product of collision between two neighboring blocks during the transition of Rodinia to Gondwana. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {This paper reports results from detrital zircon U-Pb geochronology, Hf isotopic geochemistry, sandstone modal analysis, and palaeocurrent analysis of the early Mesozoic strata within the Ningwu basin, China, with the aims of constraining the depositional ages and sedimentary provenances and shedding new light on the Mesozoic tectonic evolution of the northcentral North China Craton (NCC). The zircons from early Mesozoic sandstones are characterized by three major populations: Phanerozoic (late Palaeozoic and early Mesozoic), late Palaeoproterozoic (with a peak at approximately 1.8 Ga), and Neoarchaean (with a peak at approximately 2.5 Ga). Notably, three Phanerozoic zircons in the Early Triassic Liujiagou Formation were found to have positive epsilon(Hf)(t) values and characteristics typical of zircons from the Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB). Therefore, the CAOB began to represent the provenance of sediment in the sedimentary basins in the northern NCC no later than the Early Triassic (261 Ma), implying that the final amalgamation of the NCC and CAOB occurred before the Early Triassic. The U-Pb geochronologic and Hf isotopic results show that the Lower Middle Triassic sediments were mainly sourced from the Yinshan-Yanshan Orogenic Belt (YYOB), and that a sudden change in provenances occurred, shifting from a mixed YYOB and CAOB source in the Middle Jurassic to a primarily YYOB source in the Late Jurassic. The results of the sandstone modal analysis suggest that the majority of the samples from the Lower Middle Jurassic rocks were derived from either Continental Block or Recycled Orogen sources, whereas all the samples from the Upper Jurassic rocks were derived from Mixed sources. The change in source might be ascribed to the southward subduction and closure of the Okhotsk Ocean and the resulting intense uplift of the YYOB during the Late Jurassic. This uplift likely represents the start of the Yanshan Orogeny.},

   abstract = {The intracontinental Ordos Basin hosts many large uranium deposits, and its evolution was controlled by the surrounding orogenic belts during the Paleozoic to Mesozoic. Paleocurrent data of the Jurassic Zhiluo Formation reveal that its sedimentary detritus were transported dominantly from southwest to northeast in the basin. However, the detrital zircon age pattern of the Zhiluo Formation is similar to those of the Inner Mongolia Paleo-uplift, the Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB), the Yinshan Block, and the Khondalite Belt to the north but is remarkably different from those of the Qinling Orogenic Belt (QOB) and the North Qilian Belt to the south. Discriminant diagrams using immobile elements also reveal that the detritus of the Zhiluo Formation are dominated by felsic volcanic rocks and andesitic arc rocks, consistent with rock types in its northern orogenic units. The Zhiluo sandstones show high chemical index of weathering values (68-83), suggesting long-distance transportation and intensive weathering. These lines of evidence demonstrate that rocks from the Zhiluo Formation were recycled from underlying Permian-Triassic sediments that were ultimately sourced from the northern orogenic units. The Ordos Basin has a three-stage growth that was controlled by the formation and tectonic evolution of the QOB to the south and the CAOB to the north during the Late Carboniferous to Jurassic.},

   abstract = {The Neoproterozoic Jiangnan orogen plays an important role in the study of the Precambrian tectonic evolution of South China. The tectonic nature of the Neoproterozoic sedimentary basins is still controversial, due to poor understanding of the sedimentary sequences and the lack of geochronological data. Here, we present sedimentological, provenance and geochronological data from the Heshangzhen Group in the eastern Jiangnan orogen. Sedimentological analysis shows that the Luojiamen Formation was deposited in a submarine fan, and the overlying Hongchicun Formation was deposited in front of a fan delta. The youngest detrital zircons constrain the lower Luojiamen and Hongchicun formations with ages of 827.3 +/- 8.4 Ma and 825 +/- 12 Ma, respectively. The sandstones of the Luojiamen Formation are characterized by a large number of intermediate to felsic volcanic grains, suggesting a volcanic arc source. In contrast, quartz and sedimentary lithic grains increase in the Hongchicun Formation, showing a new input from a collisional orogenic source. Detrital zircon from six sandstone samples in the Luojiamen and Hongchicun formations yield similar age spectra of 930-820 Ma with a peak at ca. 845-860 Ma, with one main cluster at 930-820 Ma. Detrital zircons of 930-845 Ma show a positive value of (Hf) (t) (+2.4 to +11, mean +7.6), which is similar to the volcanic arc of the nearby Shuangxiwu Group. There are a minor group of zircons with U-Pb ages ranging from 820 Ma to 845 Ma from the middle part of the Luojiamen Formation and Hongchicun Formation, with (Hf) (t) values between -20 to +2.4, which are consistent with the characteristics of the Shuangqiaoshan Group. within light of the bidirectional paleocurrents in the Luojiamen Formation, it is speculated that the zircons of 820-845 Ma were recycled from the Shuangqiaoshan Group, which is derived from a continental arc to the northwest. Our data suggests that the Luojiamen Formation was formed in an inter-arc basin, while the Hongchicun Formation was formed in an accretionary wedge-top basin. When juxtaposed with the conglomeratic characteristics at the bottom of the Luojiamen Formation, it is believed that the unconformity represented by the 'Shen Gong Movement' reflects the rapid erosion and accumulation process of island arc volcanic material. The disconformity between the Luojiamen and Hongchicun formations is the imprint of transition from inter-arc basin to accretionary wedge-top basin, which represents the collision between the Shuangxiwu arc and the Yangtze Plate.},

   abstract = {The Nanwenhe-Song Chay (NSC) area straddles the border of SW China and NE Vietnam, at the tectonic junction of the Yangtze, Cathaysia, and Indochina blocks. However, the lack of a systematic understanding of the basement rocks in this area has led to a debate about its tectonic affinity. This study presents integrated bulk geochemical and zircon U-Pb-Hf isotopic data for the basement rocks in the NSC area. Zircon U-Pb dating results suggest that the Mengdong Group in SW China and the Thac Ba Formation in NE Vietnam were deposited in the late Neoproterozoic (< 619-592 Ma), while the Tianpeng Formation in SW China and the Ha Giang Formation in NE Vietnam were deposited in the Cambrian (< 527-507 Ma). Bulk geochemical data and zircon Hf-isotope compositions indicate that the sources of these sedimentary rocks were dominated by felsic rocks. The sources of the late Neoproterozoic sedimentary rocks probably underwent weaker weathering under drier and colder conditions than those of the Cambrian ones. The late Neoproterozoic Mengdong Group and the Thac Ba Formation contain abundant 802-747 Ma zircons. Their age distributions and the Hf-isotope compositions are similar to those of Neoproterozoic sedimentary rocks in the southern Yangtze Block (Fanjingshan-Sibao area). In contrast, the Cambrian Tianpeng and Ha Giang formations are characterized by Grenvillian detrital zircons with an age peak at 980 Ma. The age spectra and Hf-isotope compositions of the detrital zircons from these rocks are similar to those in the Cathaysia Block (Nanling-Yunkai area) and/or Indochina Block. Integration of our data with published geological data suggests that the Precambrian basement under the NSC area is the part of the Yangtze Block. Thus, the western boundary between Yangtze and Cathaysia blocks must be located to the south or southeast and the boundary between the South China and Indochina blocks should be to the southwest of the NSC area. Numerous Pan-African (600-500 Ma) detrital zircons and the diagnostic age spectra of detrital zircons in the early Paleozoic sedimentary rocks indicate that the SCB was located at the northern margin of East Gondwana during the early Paleozoic. The dramatic change in the clastic components from the late Neoproterozoic to Cambrian sedimentary rocks suggests that the NSC area was probably affected by the Pan-African orogeny.},

   abstract = {The Nam Co belt is located to the northeast of Song Ma fault in Northwestern Vietnam. The nature of the Precambrian basement rocks in this area and its tectonic attribute have still been controversial. In this study, zircon U-Pb-Hf isotopic compositions and whole rock geochemical compositions of meta-sedimentary rocks from the Nam Co Formation in this belt have been integrated to reveal the components and tectonic setting of the formation of the basement rocks in the Nam Co belt. Zircon U-Pb dating results show that the Nam Co Formation is of middle-late Neoproterozoic age. The lower Nam Co Formation probably formed between 821 and 726 Ma, and the upper Formation was deposited later than 726-721 Ma. The sedimentary rocks from the lower and upper Nam Co formations are characterized by numerous Neoproterozoic (900-800 Ma) detrital materials, but the upper part contains more Meso-to Paleoproterozoic sediments than the lower part. Detrital zircon age distribution and Hf-isotope compositions of the Nam Co Formation are similar to those of Neoproterozoic sedimentary rocks in the southern Yangtze Block. Both zircon U-Pb-Hf isotopic and whole rock geochemical data suggest that the source materials of the Neoproterozoic Nam Co Formation were dominated by felsic rocks with minor mafic materials, and the detrital materials were mainly derived from the Jiangnan Orogenic Belt in the southern Yangtze Block, with minor contribution from the Panxi belt in the western Yangtze Block, Ailaoshan-Song Hong and Phan Si Pan belts. The lower Nam Co Formation contains more sediments derived from the Panxi belt than the upper part. The middle-late Neoproterozoic Nam Co Formation probably was deposited in a continental extensional basin, and the sedimentation environment in later period (< 726-721 Ma) was more stable. Integration of our data with other lines of evidence suggests that the Nam Co Formation belongs to the basement of the Yangtze Block, and the Nam Co belt was originally located in the southwest corner of the Yangtze Block. This further suggests that the Song Ma fault probably is the boundary between the South China and Indochina blocks.},

   abstract = {Cimmerian terranes in Tibet are thought to be as old as Archean or as young as Neoproterozoic or even early Paleozoic in age. However, their Precambrian history and their role in the assembly and dispersal of early supercontinents (e.g., Rodinia) are still poorly known. Here, U-Pb dating, trace-element geochemistry and Lu-Hf isotopes of detrital zircons (351 grains) from the Nyaingentanglha-Group clastic rocks, the earliest strata overlying the Lhasa Block (South Tibet), are used to constrain the provenance of the sediments and test paleogeographic and tectonic models for the Lhasa Block during the breakup of the Rodinia supercontinent. The youngest detrital zircon cluster (803 +/- 5 Ma) in the clastic rocks and granitic dykes (797 +/- 10 Ma) intruding them constrain the deposition age close to 800 Ma. Four main groups of detrital zircons in these sediments record several sources, including Mesoproterozoic and Neoproterozoic juvenile terranes, a Grenvillian orogenic belt and an Archean continental-crust component. Detrital-zircon age distributions and Lu-Hf isotopic data reveal the variation of the sedimentary provenance and suggest its affinity to the Himalaya and/or the East Africa Orogen. These results show that the Lhasa Block was probably located within a giant convergent plate margin system surrounding the Rodinia supercontinent during its breakup in the Tonian time.},

   abstract = {Integrated in situ U-Pb dating and Hf-isotope analysis on detrital zircons from six sandstone samples from Hainan Island have been used to identify dastic sedimentary provenances, regional magmatic activity and crustal evolution processes. Four samples (2011XL-1,2011JB-1,09HN54 and 2011GB-1) are from previous mapped Silurian strata and the other two samples (2011TD-1 and 09HN39) belong to Ordovician and Cambrian strata, respectively. A total of 463 concordant U-Pb zircon analyses of the six samples define five major age populations: 2598-2320 Ma (a peak of 2480 Ma), 1944-1606 Ma (peak-1750 Ma), 1600-1406 Ma (peak-1502 Ma), 1288-902 Ma (peak-957 Ma), 470-427 Ma (peak-442 Ma) and two subordinate populations at 898-710 Ma (peak-730 Ma) and 618-513 Ma (peak-578 Ma). The combination of age peaks within the samples provide a record of igneous activity in the source region: the 2480 Ma peak is consistent with those ages reported for Neoarchean global continental growth; the 1944-1606 Ma population correlates with the time of assembly of the supercontinent Nuna (Columbia); the 1502 Ma peak with documented magmatic activity on Hainan Island; and the 1288-902 Ma and 898-710 Ma populations with global tectonothermal activity associated with assembly and breakup of Rodinia. Our data also reveal a 618-513 Ma population that may relate with the assembly of Gondwana. The distinctive age peak at 442 Ma indicates input from a region affected by the Kwangsian orogeny. The combined ages and Hf-isotope data for each population suggest that generation of juvenile crust occurred at 1900-1400 Ma, 940-740 Ma and 470-430 Ma. Most of the other age populations that display negative sHf(t) values suggest reworking of older crust. (C) 2014 International Association for Gondwana Research. Published by Elsevier B.V.

   abstract = {The sedimentary record in the Late Palaeoproterozoic-Neoproterozoic Bayan Obo rift belt can provide critical insight into tectonic evolution of Columbia and the North China Craton. In this study, we present new U-Pb geochronology, Hf isotopic analyses from the Bayan Obo Group, the Mesoproterozoic kimberlite, and gabbro to constrain the depositional age and potential provenance information of the Bayan Obo Group. We show that the Dulahala-Jianshan, Bilute, and Baiyinbaolage formations were deposited at ca. 1.81-1.7 Ga, ca. 1.58-1.35 Ga, and ca. 1.25-1.0 Ga, respectively. Our data suggest the following potential provenance for sediments within the Bayan Obo Group: (a) The Khondalite Belt, Yinshan Block, and crystalline basement complex of the North China Craton to the south were the most potential provenance of the Dulahala and Jianshan formations during the initial deposition of Bayan Obo Group; (b) The Yinshan Block, and crystalline basement complex of the North China Craton, and local intermediate-acid igneous rocks were the most potential provenance of the Bilute Formation; and (c) the local gabbro and volcanic rocks were the most potential provenance of the Baiyinbaolage Formation. Based on regional geologic constraints and the sedimentary history, we propose that the Northern Marginal Rift System probably represented several distinct rifting events. Furthermore, the Bayan Obo and Huade rift belts were active more recently than 1.0 Ga, which suggests that these rift systems were not only related to the rifting of the Columbia supercontinent. We propose that the Bayan Obo rift belt also records the rifting related to the breakup of Rodinia with the deposition of Qingbaikou System (Tonian) strata.},

   abstract = {In Northeast China, oceanic subduction between the Jiamusi and Songliao blocks remains topic of hot debate. The Heilongjiang Complex has been regarded as an accretionary belt resulting from the subduction of an intervening ocean between the two blocks. In this study, we carry out extensive geological, geochemical and geochronological investigations on the sedimentary rocks, amphibolites and blueschists from the Heilongjiang Complex. The detrital zircons from meta-sedimentary rocks yield U-Pb age spams ranging from 268 to 780 Ma. Whereas the interlayered amphibolites show negative Nb-Ta-Ti and positive Pb anomalies and have a protolithic age of 188.2 +/- 1.0 Ma, suggesting a subduction zone or magmatic arc origin in the Jurassic. The elevated initial Sr isotopic ratios (0.708-0.711) and negative epsilon(Nd)(t) values (-4.3 to -1.3) provide further evidence of the modification by upper continental crust during the magma ascending. LREE/HREE and MREE/HREE ratios suggest that the magma was likely derived from the mixing of lithospheric and asthenospheric melts. The presence of low Th/Ce (0.04-0.12) and Hf/Sm (0.35-0.55), but high Zr/Hf (35.4-43.4) and Pb/Ce (0.25-0.49) ratios strongly implies a contribution from subducted sediments. The identification of active continental margin type magmas of Early Jurassic age suggests that the subduction of the oceanic plate between the Jiamusi and Songliao blocks may have started around Early Jurassic time. In addition, the blueschists have a protolithic age of 186 +/- 1.1 Ma and display geochemical affinities of oceanic island basalts, suggesting that the ocean between the Jiamusi and Songliao blocks closed sometime after 186 Ma. Mineral Ar-40/Ar-39 dating results from the Heilongjiang Complex further indicate that blueschist- to greenschist-facies metamorphism occurred in the Middle to Late Jurassic (158-175 Ma), marking the onset of termination of the oceanic subduction.

   abstract = {The Heilongjiang Complex is a blueschist facies metamorphic belt located within the Zhangguangcailing Orogen between the Jiamusi and Songliao blocks in Northeast China. This complex has been regarded as an accretionary belt related to the subduction of an intervening oceanic domain between the two blocks. However, the timing of ocean closure and final amalgamation has not been well constrained, with different models arguing for a period of 210-180 Ma or sometime after similar to 140 Ma. This work reports in-situ detrital zircon U-Pb and Hf isotopic analyses of meta-sedimentary rocks from the Heilongjiang Complex. Detrital zircons from seven meta-sedimentary rocks samples yield U-Pb ages spanning from 1690 to 167 Ma, with main populations matching those of multi-phase magmatism in the Jiamusi and Songliao blocks. Several Precambrian age groups (600 Ma, 700 Ma, 900 Ma, 960 Ma, 1200 Ma, and 1300 Ma) are consistent with the inherited zircons from the mafic rocks in the Heilongjiang Complex. A comparison with compiled data of magmatic rocks suggests that the two blocks may have been connected to each other during Permian time. Detrital zircon dating of all siliciclastic rocks yielded the youngest age component of similar to 170 Ma, suggesting that the latest deposition of the mica schists happened at some time after similar to 170 Ma. We propose that the Jiamusi and Songliao blocks once existed as a single block around Late Permian, which underwent a rifting event in the Permian to form a rifting basin that was subsequently evolved into an oceanic domain (Heilongjiang Ocean). The closure of the Heilongjiang Ocean occurred after similar to 170 Ma. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

To constrain this history, we present geochemical and zircon U-Pb geochronological data from a suite of meta-sedimentary rocks within this orogenic belt. Detrital zircons ages are clustered between 1000 and 400 Ma, with major peaks at ca. 510 Ma and 460 Ma, and minor peaks at ca. 840 Ma and 650 Ma. The age groups younger than 1000 Ma broadly overlap magmatic activity at ca. 540-420 Ma and minor magmatism at 920-540 Ma in the WKOB. The age data also reveal Early Paleozoic metamorphic basement rocks in the WKOB that were probably sourced from Kunlun terranes and blocks of Gondwanan affinity rather than the Tarim Craton. Compiled geochemical data suggest a protracted subduction setting in the WKOB in the Early Paleozoic. epsilon Hf(t) values show increasing trends at 900-740 Ma and 740-600 Ma and a distinct decreasing trend at 540-420 Ma, consistent with retreating subduction during the Neoproterozoic and advancing subduction in the Early Paleozoic. The retreating-advancing subduction cycle in the WKOB was possibly related to the opening and closure of the Proto-Tethys Ocean along the margin of Gondwana.},

   abstract = {Continent-continent collision between the North China Block (NCB) and South China Block (SCB) took place along the Qinling-Tongbai-Hong'an-Dabie orogens during the Triassic. A micro-continent with Paleozoic arc magmatism has been recognized in the northern Qinling-Tongbai orogens; however, it remains unclear whether the micro-continent extended to the Dabie Orogen to form a ribbon-shaped micro-continent, due to later burial by the Hefei Basin in the north. To solve this problem, we conducted LA-ICP-MS U Pb dating of Zircons from Silurian to Cretaceous sandstones and volcanic rocks from the southern margin of the basin. The age spectra of detrital zircons suggest that the Dabie Orogen and later basin cover were the sources of the analyzed sandstones. The detrital and inherited zircons indicate Neoproterozoic, early and late Paleozoic magmatism in the Beihuaiyang unit in the north of the Dabie Orogen. The zircon and previbus geophysical data show that a micro-continent bounded by the Feizhong Suture in the north and the Xiacitian-Mozitang Suture in the south existed between the NCB and the Triassic Dabie Orogen, and its northern half is buried by the Jurassic-Paleogene Hefei Basin. The Beihuaiyang micro-continent experienced early Paleozoic arc magmatism caused by southward subduction of the Erlangping oceanic crust and late Paleozoic magmatism related to northward subduction of the Paleotethyan oceanic crust. The micro-continent was accreted to the southern edge of the NCB at the end of the Early Devonian (ca. 400 Ma) via arc-continent collision. Similarly to the Qinling-Tongbai orogens, the Dabie Orogen contains a Paleozoic accretionary system in the north and a Triassic collisional system in the south; thus, it is suggested that a ribbon-shaped micro-continent, >900 km long and 50-100 km wide, was present along the entire Qinling-Tongbai-Hong'an-Dabie orogens prior to the middle Paleozoic. This micro-continent might have originated as a result of middle Neoproterozoic rifting along the margin of the SCB. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   journal = {Precambrian Research},
   volume = {331},
   abstract = {The Pingbian Group of southeast Yunnan Province is the only exposed Precambrian unit in the southwestern corner of the South China Block (SCB). The nature of this group is crucial to reveal the basement component in the area, and to further understand Precambrian evolution of the SCB and to constrain the boundary between the Yangtze and Cathaysia blocks. Zircon U-Pb ages indicate that the Pingbian Group sedimentary rocks were deposited later than 772-710 Ma. "Cambrian" Langmuqiao formation sedimentary rocks near the Pingbian Group have the maximum deposition age and age spectra of detrital zircons similar to the Pingbian Group, suggesting that they probably belong to the Pingbian Group. The Pingbian Group sedimentary rocks have variable compositions with low SiO2/Al2O3 (3.7 similar to 9.7), implying relatively low maturity. Their REE patterns are characterized by enrichment in LREE with (La/Yb)n of 5.3-10.3. Geochemical and petrologic characteristics of these sedimentary rocks are similar to those Neoproterozoic sedimentary rocks in the southern Yangtze Block. The Pingbian Group sedimentary rocks show unimodal age spectra of detrital zircons with a peak at 844-808 Ma and minor old detritus. The age spectrum resembles those of Neoproterozoic sedimentary rocks in the southern and western Yangtze Block, but different from those in the Cathaysia and Indochina blocks, suggesting the Pingbian Group's affinity with the Yangtze Block. The integration of U-Pb ages and Hf-isotopes of detrital zircons indicates that there were five main magmatic events occurring in the southwestern Yangtze Block. Early Paleoproterozoic, late Paleoproterozoic and late Mesoproterozoic magmatism mainly involved the reworking of ancient crusts, whereas 1.7-1.5 Ga and 0.9-0.7 Ga magmatic activities were accompanied by the input of significant mantle-derived materials. Continuous Neoproterozoic mantle-derived magmatism suggests a subduction-related tectonic setting. Geochemistry of sedimentary rocks and age distribution of detrital zircons suggest that the Pingbian Group was deposited in the back-arc foreland basin. All observations suggest that the Pingbian Group is similar to those Neoproterozoic sedimentary rocks in the western Yangtze Block, and consequently the Pingbian area should belong to the Yangtze Block. Thus, the boundary between the Yangtze and Cathaysia blocks must be located at east of the study area.},

   abstract = {Contrasting models for internal versus external locations of the South China Craton (SCC) in the supercontinent Rodinia and associated mantle plume or ocean subduction dominated tectonic processes can be resolved by detrital zircon U-Pb dating and Lu-Hf isotopic analyses on the Cryogenian Nanhua Supergroup in the central SCC. Our results show that samples from the lower Liantuo, Tiesi'ao, and Datangpo formations of the Nanhua Supergroup show three age peaks at 2.50 Ga, 2.05 Ga, and 0.85 Ga, and those of the upper Nantuo Formation yield four peaks at 2.50 Ga, 2.05 Ga, 0.85 Ga, and 0.65 Ga. The Archean and Paleoproterozoic (1.80-2.10 Ga) zircons have epsilon(Hf)(t) values of -16.3 to +4.7 and -23.0 to +4.2, and may be sourced from the Kongling and Douling complexes and Paleoproterozoic intrusions in the northern Yangtze Block, respectively. Early Neoproterozoic (0.70-0.96 Ga) zircon grains show variable epsilon(Hf)(t) values of -20.0 to +15.0. In combination with the absence of Mesoproterozoic detrital zircons in the Nanhua Supergroup, huge volumes of Neoproterozoic granitic intrusions in the northern Yangtze Block are the potential sources for the 0.70-0.96 Ga detrital zircons. Only the siltstone of the Nantuo Formation has late Neoproterozoic (0.63-0.69 Ga) detrital zircons with high and positive epsilon(Hf)(t) values (+7.9 to +9.4). Several granitoid intrusions (0.63-0.68 Ga) in the Wudang and Ankang uplift of the South Qinling belt in the northern Yangtze Block provide the late Neoproterozoic detrital zircons of the Nantuo Formation. These provenance analyses of the Nanhua Supergroup indicate an interior source from the SCC, rather than an exterior source from the Laurentia and Australia cratons. The Neoproterozoic rift basins and magmatic rocks in the SCC were produced by secular episodic subductions and back-arc extensions, rather than a Neoproterozoic super-mantle plume. The SCC occupied a peripheral position adjacent to northern India in Rodinia during the Neoproterozoic. These conclusions will promote our understanding of genetic mechanism and distribution prediction of the several Cryogenian-Cambrian black-shale layers and excellent source rocks in the SCC.},

To put constraints on the provenance and tectonic settings of the Early Triassic deposition in southwestern Sichuan, the detrital compositions and major and trace elements of clastic rocks from the E'mei and Meigu sections were analyzed. The detrital components of sandstones in southwestern Sichuan are related to basaltic, short-transport, recycled clastics. Detrital zircons from the bottom of the Feixianguan Formation in the Meigu section yield U-Pb ages ranging from 246 to 280 Ma, with a major peak at similar to 258 Ma, which are consistent with those of published data from the ELIP major magmatic event. The geochemical characteristics of sandstone are similar to the high-Ti Emeishan basalt of the ELIP and Precambrian to Permian sedimentary rocks of the Yangtze Craton. These results, combined with the research findings based on paleogeography data, indicate that the Early Triassic strata in the E'mei-Meigu region probably originated from both the ELIP and Khamdian Paleoland of the inner Yangtze Craton. The formation of the Sichuan Basin was mainly controlled by the Khamdian Paleoland during that time.},

In this contribution, we conducted detrital monazite and zircon U-Pb geochronology and detrital Cr-spinel major element chemistry analyses on samples from the Qaidam Basin to reconstruct the spatial and temporal evolution of the Altyn Tagh Range and the Qimen Tagh Range in the northern Tibetan Plateau. Based on the significant variation in [Th/U](N), [Gd/Lu](N) and [Eu/Eu*](N) and the U-Pb ages of the monazite and zircon, the South Altyn Tagh subduction-collision belt and the North Qimen Tagh Range were, respectively, the main provenances of the Ganchaigou section and the Dongchaishan-Weitai section in the Qaidam Basin in the Cenozoic. Paleozoic peak metamorphism, retrograde granulite-facies metamorphism and amphibolite-facies metamorphism in the South Altyn Tagh subduction-collision belt were well recorded by the detrital monazite. In comparison, the detrital zircon is a better indicator of igneous events than detrital monazite. Synthesizing the detrital monazite, zircon and Cr-spinel data, we concluded that the South Altyn Tagh Ocean and Qimen Tagh Ocean existed in the early Paleozoic and that the Altyn Tagh terrane and Qimen Tagh terrane experienced different Paleozoic tectonothermal histories. The collision between the Qaidam terrane and the Azhong terrane occurred at ca. 500 Ma. The Middle Ordovician was the key period of transformation from the collision-induced compressional environment to an extensional environment in the area of the South Altyn Tagh Range. In the early Paleozoic, the Qimen Tagh area was characterized by the subduction of oceanic crust.},

   abstract = {The origins and Paleogeographic reconstruction of the Precambrian microcontinents in the Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB) are essential for understanding the continental crustal evolution and mechanism of accretionary orogeny. The Yili Block is one of the Precambrian microcontinents in SW CAOB and is a key component of the Kazakhstan microcontinent whose amalgamation is not yet well understood. In this study, we present detrital zircon U-Pb ages of the metasedimentary rocks from the Tekesi Group in the southern Yili Block to constrain its Precambrian history and tectonic affinity. A total of 540 concordant U-Pb zircon ages from the metasedimentary rocks defined dominantly Meso- to Paleoproterozoic detritus (1.1-1.8 Ga) with minor early Paleoproterozoic to Neoarchean and Neoproterozoic components. These results are comparable to those obtained from the northern Yili, Chinese Central Tianshan and Kyrgyz North Tianshan blocks. On the basis of careful analysis on the inner textures of dated zircons, and comparing these new results with the previous studies on magmatic rocks, it is suggested that (1) the Tekesi Group most likely deposited during the latest Mesoproterozoic-earliest Neoproterozoic (1079-963 Ma); (2) the provenances of the Meso- to late Paleoproterozoic detritus might be in situ basement rocks of the Yili Block, or the Chinese Central Tianshan, Kyrgyz North Tianshan and even exotic cratonic plates (e.g., Central Australia, Laurentia); and (3) the early Paleoproterozoic to Neoarchean components may have been derived from old cratonic plates (e.g., Tarim, Siberia). In combination with the available detrital zircon ages and regional stratigraphic data, we propose that the southern Yili Block has close tectonic affinities with the northern Yili Block, Chinese Central Tianshan, and Kyrgyz North Tianshan, and these ribbon-like microcontinents once situated on the continental margins of the constituent cratonic plates (e.g., Tarim, Siberia, Central Australia, Laurentia) during the assembly and break-up of the Columbia and Rodinia supercontinents, therefore they may offer important clues for global reconstructions of supercontinent cycles.},

   abstract = {U-Pb geochronologic and Hf isotopic results of seven sandstones collected from Late Carboniferous through Early Triassic strata of the south-central part of the North China Craton record a dramatic provenance shift near the end of the Late Carboniferous. Detrital zircons from the Late Carboniferous sandstones are dominated by the Early Paleozoic components with positive epsilon(Hf)(wt) values, implying the existence of a significant volume of juvenile crust at this age in the source regions. Moreover, there are also three minor peaks at ca. 2.5 Ga, 1.87 Ga and 1.1-0.9 Ga. Based on our new data, in conjunction with existing zircon ages and Hf isotopic data in the North China Craton (NCC), Central China Orogenic Belt (CCOB) and Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB), it can be concluded that Early Paleozoic and Neoproterozoic detritus in the south-central NCC were derived from the CCOB. Zircons with ages of 1.9-1.7 Ga were derived from the NCC. However, the oldest components can't be distinguished, possibly from either the NCC or the CCOB, or both. In contrast, detrital zircons from the Permian and Triassic sandstones are characterized by three major groups of U-Pb ages (2.6-2.4 Ga, 1.9-1.7 Ga and Late Paleozoic ages). Specially, most of the Late Paleozoic zircons show negative epsilon(Hf)(t) values, similar to the igneous zircons from intrusive rocks of the Inner Mongolia Paleo-Uplift (IMPU), indicating that the Late Paleozoic detritus were derived from the northern part of the NCC. This provenance shift could be approximately constrained at the end of the Late Carboniferous and probably hints that tectonic uplift firstly occurred between the CCOB and the NCC as a result of the collision between the South and North Qinling microcontinental terranes, and then switched to the domain between the CAOB and the NCC. Additionally, on the basis of Lu-Hf isotopic data, we reveal the pre-Triassic crustal growth history for the NCC. In comparison among the three crustal growth curves obtained from modern river sands, our samples, and the Proterozoic sedimentary rocks, we realize that old components are apparently underestimated by zircons from the younger sedimentary rocks and modern river sands. Hence, cautions should be taken when using this method to investigate growth history of continental crust. (C) 2013 International Association for Gondwana Research. Published by Elsevier B.V.

   abstract = {The North Qinling terrain reveals a different geological history from the North China block to the north and the South Qinling micro-continental block to the south. The timing of events and geochemical features of the North Qinling terrain are essential for understanding the evolution of the Qinling orogenic belt that joins the North and South China blocks. This study presents detrital zircon ages and Hf isotopic compositions from the Guandaokou Group, a cover sequence of the North China block, and from the Kuanping Group, an upper basement sequence of the North Qinling terrain. The youngest detrital zircon U-Pb ages constrain the initiation of sedimentation in the Guandaokou Group to 1.85 Ga and the maximum depositional age of the Kuanping Group to similar to 640 Ma. Zircon U-Pb ages and Hf data testify to a major phase of magmatism in the North Qinling terrain at similar to 1000-900 Ma. The magmatic rocks were largely produced from reworking of early Paleoproterozoic (similar to 2.5-2.0 Ga) crust with minor contribution of late Paleoproterozoic (similar to 1.7 Ga) juvenile material. This age record differs in time from the two important thermal events of similar to 1.85 Ga and similar to 2.5 Ga, widely manifested in the North China block. The North Qinling terrain can thus be regarded as a separate micro-continent with a pre-Neoproterozoic evolution different from that of the North China block. The final assembly of the North Qinling terrain to the North China block took place after about 640 Ma. (C) 2011 International Association for Gondwana Research. Published by Elsevier B.V.

   abstract = {In situ U-Pb and Hf analyses were used for crustal zircon xenocrysts from Triassic kimberlites exposed in the Rangnim Massif of North Korea to identify components of the basement hidden in the deep crust of the Rangnim Massif and to clarify the crustal evolution of the massif. The U-Pb age spectrum of the zircons has a prominent population at 1.9-1.8 Ga and a lack of Archaean ages. The data indicate that the deep crust and basement beneath the Rangnim Massif are predominantly of Palaeoproterozoic age, consistent with the ages of widely exposed Palaeoproterozoic granitic rocks. In situ zircon Hf isotope data show that most of the Palaeoproterozoic zircon xenocrysts have negative epsilon(Hf)(t) values (-9.7 to +0.7) with an average Hf model age of 2.86 +/- 0.02 Ga (2 sigma), which suggests that the Palaeoproterozoic basement was not juvenile but derived from the reworking of Archaean rocks. Considering the existence of Archaean remanent material in the Rangnim Massif and their juvenile features, a strong crustal reworking event is indicated at 1.9-1.8 Ga, during which time the pre-existing Archaean basement was exhausted and replaced by a newly formed Palaeoproterozoic basement. These features suggest that the Rangnim Massif constitutes the eastern extension of the Palaeoproterozoic Liao-Ji Belt of the North China Craton instead of the Archaean Liaonan Block as previously thought. A huge Palaeoproterozoic orogen may exist in the eastern margin of the Sino-Korean Craton.},

   abstract = {Combined with the previous detrital zircons U-Pb ages of the two Precambrian successions, i.e. the Shilu Group and the Shihuiding Formation in Hainan Island of South China, the in situ Lu-Hf isotopes of detrital zircons were performed to evaluate the growth and reworking of Hainan Island continental crust during Precambrian. The results of 171 Hf-isotopic analyses on zircon grains from the Shihuiding Formation yield Hf-176/Hf-177 ratios between 0.280786 and 0.281188, Lu-176/Hf-177 ratios between 0.000228 and 0.003388, Hf model ages (T-DM(C)) between 3.8 Ga and 1.2 Ga, and epsilon(Hf)(t) values ranging from -12.5 to +10.6. The analyzed results of 272 Hf-isotopic data on zircon grains from the Shilu Group exhibit a wide range of Hf-176/Hf-177 ratios (0.280810-0.282512), Lu-176/Hf-177 ratios (0.000062-0.004060), T-DM(C) ages (3.7 Ga-1.1 Ga), and epsilon(Hf)(t) values (-20.5 to +12.3). The continental crust of Hainan Island maybe appeared firstly at ca. 4.0-3.8 Ga and then was reworked. The 91.8% of detrital zircon grains from the Shihuiding Formation and 93.8% of the ones from the Shilu Group have crustal incubation time larger than 300 Ma, indicating an involvement of reworked materials into the sedimentation of both the successions. Unambiguously, the crustal basement rocks in Hainan Island were formed mainly through reworking the previous continental components with minor input of juvenile materials. The generation of juvenile curst in Hainan Island predominantly occurred at ca. 2.7 Ga and ca. 1.5-1.0 Ga, which are consistent with that for the assembly of the Kenorland, and the Columbia breakup and subsequent amalgamation of the Rodinia, respectively. The present study further reveals that the crustal growths in Hainan Island are present at 2.7 Ga, 2.3 Ga and 2.1-1.8 Ga, which is more favorable to the episodic growth mode. Moreover, a rough trend of decreasing maximum crustal incubation time of Hainan Island demonstrates that the incubation time of the juvenile crust is shorter when compared with that of the Cathaysia Block in the late Mesoproterozoic. Link to the previously reported geological works, we consider that Hainan Island did not share the same evolution history with the Cathaysia Block of South China during Precambrian.

   abstract = {The North China Craton (NCC) is thought to experience multi-stage extensional events after the breakup of the Columbia (Nuna) Supercontinent, and even during the assembly of the Rodinia Supercontinent. In recent years, volcanic and detrital zircon U-Pb dating ages provided new insights into the Mesoproterozoic to Neoproterozoic tectonic framework in the NCC. As the Mesoproterozoic Xiong'er Group in the southern NCC is regarded as the oldest volcanic-sedimentary succession after the final amalgamation of the NCC, we reviewed the sedimentary environments and provenances of Mesoproterozoic to Neoproterozoic sedimentary sequences above the strata in order to understand tectono-sedimentary evolution of the southern NCC during this period. The early Mesoproterozoic sedimentary rocks were deposited in alluvial-fan to fluvial and (fan-) delta-coastal environments suggesting an initial stage of basin development. Fine-grained clastic sedimentary rocks interlayered with carbonate deposition formed on the southern NCC later, and implied a broad subsidence before ca. 1611 Ma. After that, depositional breaks caused by regional tectonic uplifts led to different sedimentary sequences and lateral migration of the depocenter from the north to the south (to the current co-ordinates). The unconformably overlying sedimentary rocks in the north of the southern NCC were deposited in restricted marine basins during late Mesoproterozoic to Neoproterozoic as a whole. However, the enlargement of shallow-marine shelf led to the thick accumulation of carbonates in the southernmost NCC characterized by a deepening-upward trend from the late Mesoproterozoic sequence. The Neoproterozoic sedimentary sequence is typified by sharp increasing terrigenous supplies and frequent changes in environment, and could be deposited in a tectonically active basin in consideration of its close association with volcanism. Detrital zircon grains from the oldest clastic sequence (i.e., the Bingmagou Formation) overlying the Xiong'er volcanic-sedimentary rocks and from the earliest Paleozoic sedimentary rocks (i.e., the Xinji Formation) are used to track changes of provenances. Detrital zircon grains from the Bingmagou Formation display two dominant age peaks at ca. 1850 and 2500 Ma and three secondary peaks at ca. 2100, 2350 and 2700 Ma. In contrast, detrital zircon grains from the Xinji Formation have three major age peaks at ca. 1850, 2200 and 2500 Ma and three subordinate populations of 950, 1100 and 1450 Ma. In combination with the uplifts during the Mesoproterozoic to Neoproterozoic, Neoproterozoic magmatism, and a large amount of detrital zircon derived from Rodinia-related orogenesis in the southern NCC, it is very likely that the major changes of basin configuration could be related to significant tectonic readjustment along with the evolution of the Rodinia Supercontinent.},
